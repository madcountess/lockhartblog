## On Representation  
"Representation" discourse is poisoned by aspirational thinking.  
Sure, they may share an identifier,  
but the liberalists in hollywood,  
and in the armchairs of wealthy showrunners,  
will never represent anybody in the working class.  

That's kinda against American Media's whole thing.  

Even if it's unintentional,  
it really bugs me to death that someone like Elliot Page can get up there,  
and talk about the experience of being trans as if his experiences line up with ours.  
I hope he understands that,  
but I don't think he do.  

Identity is used as a method of control.  
Splitting us up into smaller and smaller categories,  
trying to get us in line with our rich representatives,  
making revolution less likely.  
with or without intent, the motive exists, the incentive exists, the conditions exist to divide.  

The liberation of trans people will not come from movements that advise against revolution,  
or that aim to make everything seem revolutionary that is not.  
Liberation will come on the shoulders of our fellow workers,  
and will involve tearing down these "representatives."  
if you want civil rights, you're gonna have to help us fight for them,  
and at some point, that gets ugly, and when it gets ugly,  
these "representatives" will decry us, disavow us, and turn us in.

I understand the want,  
but that feeling is a desire to be recuperated.  
Fight it.
