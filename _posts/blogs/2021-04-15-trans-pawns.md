## On The Use of Trans People as Pawns  
it's real cool how Both Sides are currently trying to use trans folks as political pawns for maintaining control.  
I really love hearing some useless statement gets met with a bill making trans kids unable to get treatment,  
or remain with their families.  
It's so cool.  
I love it.

The Democrats: Trans Women Are Women! We Can Agree!  
The Republicans: Eradicate Transness By Any Means Possible!

Dems: Trans People Exist! We Can All Agree!  
Reps: How About We Make That Not True?

Dems: Trans Woman In The House! We're Releasing Guidance Against Genital Surgery On Intersex Bab-  
Reps: Medicine Is Evil, So Is Abnormality, Fuck Trans Kids And Their Loving Parents

"The Texas bill would take trans kids from their parents if their parents support their gender confirmation.  
This isn’t a joke, It’s not hyperbole.  
This was never about sports.  
It was never about bathrooms.  
We told you that.  
Nobody listened.  
This is what it’s always been about."

You really think the democrats are gonna save us?  
They couldn't save themselves from drowning in a shin-deep pool.  
We have to help ourselves in unity with our fellow workers,  
because the people up there in the City on the Hill are eating us alive and they   
don't.  
care.  

I'm not saying that there are no democrats who care about trans people,  
I think a lot of them genuinely do,  
but they're not willing to do what needs to be done to protect us,  
and that's going to come back to bite them in the end.

Protect yourselves.  
Protect each-other.  
Find armor in community.  
Find strength within each-other.  
Find strength within yourselves.  
There's not a thing stopping us,  
just a group of well-paid incompetent quacks.

In case you don't know what I mean by
