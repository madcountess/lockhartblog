## Corporate Exploitation of Community Resources
3D Printing Channels have changed a lot in the past few years,  
and I had some... thoughts.

2019: Kickstarters and Strange Materials  
2020: Cheapest best mask guard holder tips and tricks  
2021: Crowdsourcing the Design Process

I think the maker space is going to be full of people who started  
by taking 5 minutes messing with a design software to do something the Fan Showdown  
or the Best Wheel Design prompts in Major Hardware and Maker's Muse's videos for fun.

That's skill-training!

Okay, so it's a penis fan,  
but you had to learn how to modify a template provided for a motor hub  
to submit your design and have a genuinely sweet-seemin' guy awkwardly joke about it  
while rigorously testing your dickfan, and he provides DATA for those designs.  

like, legit,  
the prompt is "Make something better than Noctua's Industry Standard just by changing the blade design"

a company reached out to get to a designer  
who submitted one of the most surprisingly powerful designs,  
and it was their first design.

Everything Is Connected.

You can't separate the undeniable good these people are doing for the maker community  
by inspiring people to give design a try,  
from the fact that this data will likely inform the industry in ways  
that will not benefit the people who provided it.
it's communities doing what communities do: share.  
and because there's nothing stopping corporations from exploiting communities,  
they will do so enthusiastically.
If communities are to exist in peace,  
corporations must pass away,  
because if a corporation exists,
it will exploit communities.
weird to think about, right?
