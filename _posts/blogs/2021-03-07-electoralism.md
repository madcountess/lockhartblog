## On Electoralism in 2020
the 2000 dollar thing could've been an easy win for the democrats,  
but they don't care about workers to the point that they don't care if workers never vote for them again eh?  
That's how they seem to act, at least, and it's baffling unless they're trying to throw the game. ðŸ¤”

Child Poverty was not affected today, and the fact that they're nickle-and-diming the people who voted  
in a runoff to get Warnock and Ossof in office means they either don't want to win  
or are so detached from reality they think 2022 won't be an electoral trainwreck.  
There is a reason I've started more explicitly speaking out against electoralism,  
and that reason is "harm reduction."  
You remember how much you heard about "harm reduction" during the election?  
Well, harm to the establishment is certainly in decline.  
Once people start questioning the establishment again,  
you will see how quickly they turn around to give us placating nonsense  
and squish out all dissent with concern trolling and other gaslighty trash.  
Once again, if the republicans REALLY ARE as bad as the democrats say they are,  
they only have themselves to blame when people continue to die within and without our borders.  

or, in short: Political parties are not your friends ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
