## On Incrementalism vs Revolutionism
The most frustrating sentiment I see on a pretty regular basis is:  
"revolutionism is dangerous, incrementalism is fine."  
I believe strictly the opposite.  

I think Incrementalism is much more dangerous in the long run,  
because not enough strides are taken, and they're erased at will.  
we get incrementalism when it comes to queer rights,  
we got Civil Unions and shit but it's still legal to fire someone for being trans,  
and now a lot of well-off queer folks are doing the "fuck you, got mine" act,  
because that's the point of incrementalism.  

Would a big violent revolution be a good idea?  
uh, no.  
that would legitimately be suicide.  
there's no way we could pull that off without becoming the Soup Can Burial Squad.  
What do we do?  
Fight for change and never stop fighting until the workers own the world.  
We can push owners and politicians to their limits until they give in or strike back in ways that make us look good,  
there's no reason to stop with voting and legislation, or slow down.  
Act Directly.  
"Do not wait to strike until the iron is hot, but make it hot by striking."  

I've been told these ideas are "accelerationist" which is... not true.  
I'm not an "acceleration" ist, so much as a "don't stop now" ist.  
The only people telling you to slow down are the people who already own the world.  
They don't want to give it up.  
That's not my bloody problem.
