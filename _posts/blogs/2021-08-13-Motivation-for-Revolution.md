The Human Element is worth the struggle and bloodshed,  
because true freedom will give us more time with each-other.

That's really my motivation for revolution,  
just being able to sit with and listen to a friend in their dying days,  
without having to run back home for waged labor.  

That's my motivation for revolution,  
less focus on dying to sustain a life we cannot live,  
for business owners,  
and more focus on living a life worth living,  
for ourselves and each-other,  
not as Individuals,  
or as Workers,  
but as Humans.

That's my motivator for revolution,  
no more conflation of Consent with Compel,  
no more conflation of Labor with Work,  
no more conflation of Affection with Assault,  
and no more conflation of Freedom with Liberalism,  
or Capitalism,  
or Fascism,  
or Patriotism,  
or anything but Freedom.

if all this is about is struggle,  
I'm out.  
if it's all about Doing The Good Deeds,  
I'm out.  
if what we're Working For is less important than Working For something,  
I'm out.  
Revolutionaries dream of brighter tomorrows and see our work as salvation.  
Reformists dream of fonder yesterdays and see our work as violence.

The only time I hear a desire from Liberalism that isn't just "more of what we have now, and faster,"  
it's "I want to go back to how things were before everything sucked."

For conservatives, it's Jim Crow,  
for progressives, it's the New Deal,  
and for revolutionaries, it's Tomorrow.

I know many reformists pretend that what we want is Utopia,  
or we want a turn on the State Machine to Oppress Non-Believers,  
but they cannot see past their fonder yesterday to see the brutality today.

We want freedom.

That's my motivation for revolution,  
a brighter tomorrow.
