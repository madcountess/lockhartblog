## On Boycotting Georgia  
It's not so simple as "South Bad" or "South Good," it's BOTH.

Yee yee! We got [@traecrowder](https://twitter.com/traecrowder) droppin' a video on the subject as well!  
It's good to hear someone with more of an accent than m'self talk about our situation as southerners <3  
[watch here (youtube)](https://youtu.be/BNMKB5-V0cc)  
To repeat myself:  
"We southerners ain’t stupid,  
we know what’s happening,  
we know the people in charge don’t give a single damn about us!  
We know they think we’re idiots for “MaKiNg BaD dEcIsIoNs” like we got a choice."  

We made Georgia blue, we elected 2 blue senators, now what?  

We elected Warnock and Ossoff to get those 2000 dollar checks they promised us.  
The DNC put up signs sayin "Warnock your Ossoff"  
and tellin' us "elect them, and 2k$ checks will be out the door."  
Now Liberals across the country wanna punish us because our leadership sucks.  
fuck off.  

I know for CERTAIN y'all are gonna want us to vote blue again, but guess what:  

I CAN'T TALK TO THOSE PEOPLE AGAIN.  
I RELAYED A LIE TO THEM.  
Was that my fault?  
Was I supposed to just ignore help?  
What am I supposed to tell people next time I knock on a door?  
I'll say "stay home."  

This is why I push for unionization and a general strike.

They gonna keep "jivin' you and me for some votes [...] with their false promises,"  
[to quote one of my biggest inspirations, Malcolm X.](https://peoplesbayo.net/2021/02/21/unity-x.html)

There is no peace in electoralism.

We are at war, and the union makes us strong.
