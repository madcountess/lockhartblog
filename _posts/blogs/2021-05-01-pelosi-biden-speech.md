## Pelosi, Biden, and a Dumb Email
So, today, I got a very dumb email from Nancy Pelosi.  
I wanted to talk about it briefly, because I think it's important.  
It goes as follows:

"I’m floored.  
I need to talk to you about Joe Biden’s speech.   
Where dozens of Republicans refused to show up.  
Where no Republicans stood up to acknowledge what we’ve done.   
And where no Republicans chose the American people over partisanship.   
Luna, I personally invited Joe to give this speech in front of Congress.  
And I won’t let Republicans sabotage his big night out of spite.  
Will you chip in $15 before midnight and help me prove to every last Republican that we are PROUD of our president?  
I really want to reach 10,000 gifts before midnight if we can.

Thank you,
Nancy"

I say this with all due respect, Madame Speaker, but I am not proud of Joe Biden.  
He has not done a single thing that has pleased me, and he's not about to start.  
Viva La Revolucion, Madame Speaker.

Also, the republicans are just like democrats in yet another way:  
Partisan to a fault.

Of COURSE republicans wouldn't respect Biden.  
He just is not their guy... at least by what they say.  
By actions, he's their guy 100%  
"Nothing Will Fundamentally Change" was it? yeah.  

"nothing will fundamentally change"  
the "civility" of racists  
"nobody's standard of living will change"  

it's one thing to be a liberal, it's another to be a flat-out stooge.

and again, with all due respect, Madame Speaker, but F civility.  
Revolution will not be civil, it will be won by pens, guns, and Bayonets.  
People like me.  
People who are tired, done,  
and struggling to pay our bills without giving up everything that keeps us sane.
Madame Speaker.  

Be thankful of the CIA for suppressing revolutionary action, because otherwise the entire owning class would be in serious trouble right now.
