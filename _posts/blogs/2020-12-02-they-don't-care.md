## Democrats and Republicans Don't Care About You  
Democrats are spineless and void like a ream of paper is to a book.  
The next 4 years will show this in spades, and I intend to talk about it frequently.  
If that bothers you, I hope to give you good reason to agree with me,  
alongside good ways to mitigate their interference.  
I won't hold it against you if I make you mad.

That interference will sound like support, it will sound like progress,  
it will sound like they care about you at all.  
Here's the thing: It isn't, it won't be, and they don't give a fuck about you past the money in your wallet.  
They will tell you this concern with their focus on money is unfounded, that the focus is an economic issue,  
that people like me are secretly anti-semitic or using my identity as a smokescreen.

These are lies.

They are beholden to the stock market, not the working class.  
Republicans will continue to hold a monopoly on economic issues that speak to the working class,  
continue to pretend that they aren't just worse Democrats.

Neither party cares.

To them, we are just numbers;  
however, there is power in numbers.  
To a Working Unity, friends.
