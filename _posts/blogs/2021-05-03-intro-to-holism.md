## Introduction to Holism: I'm not insane... okay maybe a bit.  
Have you ever felt switches clunk into place in your brain?  
have you connected thoughts that were unconnected?  
is there something inherent about dealing the interconnectedness of the problems we face on a daily basis that keeps us from drawing these lines or what?

It's not A competition, it's all competitions!  
it's not AN individual, it's all individuals!  
it's not A problem it's ALL PROBLEMS!  
It's not just one thing, is it?  
It's the intersections, the connections, that's the point I'm trying to reach!  
like "wait, it's all of the above?"  
\*Astronaut w/ Gun: "Always Has Been"*  

and you know, something strikes me about what I keep finding at the intersections between Class and Identity.  
Identity is nowhere near the roots, but somehow, class is.  
Identity is a measure by which oppression is doled out, right?  
no.  
of course not.  
it's a justification for it.  

the separation between "what I feel to be true about myself" and "what other people think is true about me"   
has ceased to exist in an identitarian society.  
identity isn't the problem,  
it's just used to justify oppression through class,  
it's used as a way to police ourselves.

this jump to use identity as justification for things other than oppression is not new,  
but it is encouraged by those who have something to lose  
if we all stopped fighting and did something about the conditions we're faced with directly.  
Capitalism has no room for us.  
make room.  
we can thrash at the bars on our cages,  
we can commence with the weeping and the gnashing of teeth,  
but if we still pretend that the cages we're given to live in are even real,  
we can be kept inside of them,  
away from each-other.
