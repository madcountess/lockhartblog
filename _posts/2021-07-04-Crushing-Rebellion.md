# Crushing Rebellion  
Nothing Can Shift Detective Lockhart From Her Mission... Right?  

The hum of fluorescent lights above, the murmuring of voices,  
A tall man with skin like rocks and a beard like a bearskin hat,  
and the wisdom of ages buried in the creases that form across his forehead.  
"Luna." said a low, but stern voice, deep and dark as the bottom of the sea.
"Do you understand your mission?"

A ginger lass with a stare like freshly sharpened daggers focused her gaze on the speaking man,  
this lass is me, an agent for the US government, and his presence always made me antsy.  
"Yes, of course," I replied, "infiltrate, extract, interrogate, and execute."

The chief smiles "Saying the quiet part loud, I see. You should be more careful, Detective Lockhart."

"Oh who's gonna tell on me? me? to whom? you, mister Quincy?" I impulsively snapped back, before catching myself as he furrowed his brow, "err... sorry. I'll be more careful."

Chief Quincy smiles "you can be a bit of a brat sometimes, you know that? I worry about you."

"Worry not, sir. As long as Lockhart is on the case, there will be no revolution."

So, how did I come to the side of revolution? well, the chief was right to worry, but I'm not sure he knew how founded his fear would become.

but now, the dramatic irony part.  
I'll check back in later.

My mark is the growing group of communists,  
known as The People's Bayonet,  
lead by a person named Bay.  
They is a talented propagandist,  
but they's certainly more bark than bite.  
I bet they likes a challenge.  
Ginger twink with a hormone addiction,  
Bay is definitely operating at cost.  
if I need to, I'll use they economic vulnerabilities against them,  
I know what it's like to be that low...

Regardless, the work must be done.  
Communism is an existential threat for these United States.  
I find my way through the internet to this group,  
and first contact comes from... Bay themself.  

We agreed to meet on the condition that we meet alone,  
with no devices, and no weapons.  
That seemed a little... excessive, but I mean,  
they is literally watching out for people like me.  
I spoke with her online, late at night around 9:30 or 10PM,  
and I'm not sure it went particularly well for me.  

Bay: This restaurant, downtown,  
I know the workers there,  
they have a back room for us.  

Lockhart: That seems like a trap, to be honest.  

Bay: Do we have a reason to trap you?  

Lockhart: Well, not... really?  
Y'all seem like a very spiky org,  
Honestly, I'm just worried about getting jumped for being a perceived threat.

Bay: Honestly, you worry too much.  
If it helps, you can tell a friend where you're going,  
but they can't come with.  

Lockhart: Okay, deal.  

Bay: Tonight, 10:30, be there if you really are ready to act.  

Lockhart recoils from the screen, "Wait, tonight?  
I can't organize a... response... right.  
That's probably why."  

Lockhart: 10:30, see you soon!  

Lockhart: Hey there, comrade, any illegal crime plans?  

Bay: Very funny, agent.  

Lockhart: Sorry, I just find all this paranoia a little unfounded.  

Bay: Yeah, tell it to Fred Hampton.  

Lockhart: Whoa, what are you accusing me of?  

Bay: I'm just trying to figure you out.  
  I know someone with very little presence showing up at my digital front door is a bit suspicious.  

Lockhart: Okay, that's fair.  
  What need I do?

(to-do: screening scene)
Bay: How comfortable are you with theory?

Lockhart: it's necessary, but difficult to get through.

Bay: Who have you read?

Lockhart: I've read Marx and Engels and Kropotkin

Bay's face morphs from serious to bemused
Bay: uh-huh.
  I've heard that one a lot.

Lockhart: is that not good enough or something?
  so much for the tolerant left... ðŸ™„

Bay: ...
  you are an odd creature, miss Lockhart.  
  that's perfectly fine, you just have more to read.  
  I'll give you a list once I've accepted you.

Lockhart: okay, but what do I do now?
  is this really another "just read theory" group?
  I honestly thought this was more than a book club.

Bay: It is, miss Lockhart.
  but there are forces beyond us trying to shut us down,  
  so you gotta sift out the state agents,
  I believe I made myself clear talking about Fred Hampton.

Lockhart: oh.
  well, I can understand the value of a secret.  
  I've worked with organizations before,  

Memory -
flash of tied up independent newscasters,  
bound standing, blindfolded, covered in red marks,  
Lockhart standing nearby with Cat o' Nine Tails in hand,  
devilish grin across her face, dressed like a fetish object,
newscasters all screaming "MALACHITE!"  

Lockhart:
  though never on a roster.  
  that never felt safe, to me.  
  This is the first time I've felt comfortable putting my real name on a list,  
  so I hope that means to you what it means to me.

Bay: Hmm.  
  You may be valuable to our operation.  
  I'll keep your name in mind next time I'm looking for a newbie.  

Lockhart: Yes'm, I will await your call.

I didn't expect such a strong personality in person,  
I figured she left it all on set like the newscasters,  
but I think she's serious.  
Maybe the Chief should know.
