Hillary lost.  
Trump won.  
And people are complaining about Russians.  
This country has serious issues...

Well, I have some thoughts about this election, now that it's all over, and it feels like this outcome was inevitable.  
The Democrats were greedy, Bernie Sanders made a valiant effort, but it wasn't enough to break the Democratic National Committee.  
Sanders' messaging hit home for a lot of younger folks, like myself, and positioned himself as the positive, perhaps reformist, anti-establishment candidate.  
Trump's messaging hit home for a lot of working class folks, like myself, and positioned himself as the negative, perhaps destructive, anti-establishment candidate.  

The Democrats went with Hillary Clinton.  
This is why they lost.

If Trump is as bad as they say he is, it's going to be their fault, their greed, their incalculable incompetence at making a dent in the armor around the hearts and minds of millions, is going to be responsible for him being in office.  
Trump's campaign was a trainwreck.  
MSM couldn't look away.  
Millions in free advertising for every weird thing Trump did.  
Now what?  
Well, we keep working, maybe tomorrow will be brighter if we light a beacon for freedom.  
So, grab a match.
