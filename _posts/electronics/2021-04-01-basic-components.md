Ahoy hoy!  
I'm Luna.

I mentioned we would talk about basic components and how to read a basic circuit diagram,  
so let's talk about basic components and how to read a basic circuit diagram!  

### Confounding Terms  
Conductance, Resistance, and Insulation all describe the same property, differing in intent.
A Conductor like a Wire is meant to have as little resistance as possible,  
A Resistor is meant to have a set amount of resistance to current flow, but notably, allowing flow,  
and An Insulator is meant to have at-least a certain resistance to current flow to prevent it from happening.  
I'm sure there are exceptions, but this is how I think of Conductors, Resistors, and Insulators.  
For the sake of sanity, everything I'll be discussing will be pretending we're dealing with ideal circuits,  
as such, all conductors have 0 resistance, and all insulation has infinite resistance.  
This means you will not hear me say "conductor," "conductance," or "insulation" just "wire" and "resistor."  

So, This is a resistor.  
It is a cheap resistor.  
I got a huge box of 'em from china,  
and they've been absolutely fantastic for projects.  
I feel a necessity to reject the idea that stuff from China is Cheap And Bad,  
the workers in China are plenty skilled.  
Westerners tend to have a habit of denigrating cheap shit from China,  
and that's just unfair, and I think spreads bias against East Asian people and sinophobia.
