Ahoy hoy!  
I'm Luna.  
The People's Bayonet at peoplesbayo.net.  
Comin' at you live from occupied Georgia!  
I tried to do electronics instruction last year,  
and I feel like I kinda ended up flubbing a lot of it,  
so here we go again.  

I like to think of Electricity as a Fluid, like Water or Air.
As such, it's time for metaphors and definitions.  

Imagine a giant tank filled with an infinite supply of water at atmospheric pressure.  
If you were to poke a hole in the tank,  
water will start flowing through that hole.  
If you were to make that hole bigger,  
more water will flow through per-second than with a smaller hole.  
The pressure did not change, but the flow rate did.  
If you were to increase the pressure in the tank,  
the flow rate will also increase,  
even if the hole remains the same.  

so this means that the Flow Rate is equal to the Pressure divided by the Resistance provided by the size of the hole.
Or, in electronic terms: Current is equal to the Voltage divided by Resistance.
In the real world, passing a certain amount of water at a certain pressure requires a certain amount of Power.  
That Power is equal to the Pressure/Voltage multiplied by the Current/Flow.  
This gives us the 4 cardinal terms of Electronics, and with that,  
we can discuss one of the most important distinction that most people learn incorrectly.

It's frequently said that it's not the Voltage that kills, it's the Current,  
but that's like saying "it's not the speed of the car that kills, it's the strength of the wall."  
The thing that "kills" is the relation between Pressure and Flow.  
High Pressure with a Low Flow is what you get with a spray nozzle,  
and spray nozzles don't kill that many people.  
Low Pressure with a High Flow is what you get with an open hose,  
and open hoses don't kill that many people.  
High Pressure with High Flow is what you get with a water cutter and...  
[Water Cutters are Dangerous][01]  
Granted, if you were to get High Pressure and High Flow through your finger, it'd hurt, but it wouldn't kill you.  
The thing that kills you is when there's high enough pressure or voltage to pass high enough flow or current through your vital organs like your heart.  
If you ensure that there is no current path through your body, high pressure and high flow are only dangers to your fingertips.  

To that end, let's do a little safety demonstration.  
Do not try this at home, I'm an idiot, and I am teaching you how to not die.  


To think of current, imagine a giant dam with water open to atmospheric pressure, and you at the bottom with a drill. if you poke a hole in the dam it will start flowing water through that hole. If you make the hole bigger, there is less restriction, so more water will flow through. If you want to increase the flow rate, you will have to either reduce the restriction or increase the pressure, because Flow, or Current, is equal to Pressure, or Voltage, divided by Restriction, or Resistance.
If you were to encounter a high pressure line with a restricted flow, it may hurt you, especially if the pressure is high enough, just as a low pressure line with a non-restricted flow may not, but a high pressure line without restriction will make certain the flow absolutely kills you.
"It's the current, not the voltage" is a nonsensical thing to say, because it's all 3 parts of the equation.
Your skin has a certain resistance, and at that resistance, some voltages won't pass current through your body, but if your hands are wet, your resistance is decreased, so that EXACT same power supply could be deadly.
This is why the point of electronics safety education should be how to make sure any accidents that do happen not be deadly.
More important than  voltage or current is making sure you do not have a current path through your body whenever voltages are high enough to be an issue for your natural electrical resistance, regardless of the assumed current on tap
