Ahoy hoy!  
I'm Luna.  
The People's Bayonet at peoplesbayo.net.  
I tried to do electronics instruction last year,  
and I feel like I kinda ended up flubbing a lot of it,  
so here we go again.  

I like to think of Electricity as a Fluid, like Water or Air.
As such, it's time for metaphors and definitions.  

Imagine a giant tank filled with an infinite supply of water at atmospheric pressure.  
If you were to poke a hole in the tank,  
nothing will happen, because there is no pressure difference between the inside and outside.  
if you increase the pressure, however,  
water will start flowing through that hole until the pressure differential is equalized,  
either as the tank becomes empty or the world around it fills with water from that infinite source.  
If you were to make that hole bigger,  
more water will flow through per-second than with a smaller hole.  
The pressure did not change, but the flow rate did.  
If you were to increase the pressure in the tank,  
the flow rate will also increase,  
even if the resistance to flow from the hole remains the same.  
in Electronics, Flow is equal to Pressure divided by Resistance.  
Or, in electronic terms: Current is equal to Voltage divided by Resistance.
the material the tank and pipe walls are made from can handle a certain amount of power,  
which, in electronics, can be calculated as the multiple of pressure and flow, or Voltage times Current.  
if that power rating is exceeded, deformation and rupture may occur, which aren't very good for you.  

In electronics, Pressure is measured in Volts,  
Flow or Current is measured in Amps,  
Resistance is measured in Ohms,  
and Power is measured in Watts.

This gives us the 4 cardinal terms of Electronics,  
Resistance, Voltage/Pressure, Current/Flow, and Power.
You can calculate any of the values here as long as you have 2, using Ohm's Law and Joule's Law.
Ohm's Law is represented as a triangle with Voltage on the top, Current and Resistance on the bottom.
Current is represented as I, because C is Capacitance, and we are NOT GOING THERE YET.
Joule's Law is represented as a triangle with Power on the top, Current and Voltage on the bottom.
I remember these by saying Voltage = Is * Rad, Power = Is * Vlad, and with that,  
we can discuss one of the most important distinctions that most people learn incorrectly.

It's frequently said that it's not the Voltage that kills, it's the Current,  
but that's like saying "it's not the speed of the car that kills, it's the strength of the wall."  
The thing that "kills" is the relation between Pressure and Flow.  
High Pressure with a Low Flow is what you get with a spray nozzle,  
and spray nozzles don't kill that many people.  
Low Pressure with a High Flow is what you get with an open hose,  
and open hoses don't kill that many people.  
High Pressure with High Flow is what you get with a water jet cutter and...  
[Water Cutters are Dangerous][01]  
Granted, if you were to get High Pressure and High Flow through your finger, it'd hurt, but it wouldn't kill you.  
The thing that kills you is when there's high enough pressure or voltage  
to pass high enough flow or current through your vital organs like your heart.  
If the voltage divided by the resistance of your skin is not high enough,  
the current that passes will be negligible.  
If that value IS high enough, on the other hand,  
the amount of current possible at that voltage will be the determining factor.  
If you ensure that there is no current path through your body,  
high pressure and high flow are only dangers to your fingertips.  

To that end, let's talk safety.  
For the sake of demonstration,  
these cables are assumed to be live at line voltage,  
that's 120 volts in the US.
They should NOT be live at ALL,  
but always assume they could be conducting high voltage high current.  
We have 3 cables, Live or Hot, Neutral or Return, and Earth or Ground.  
When hooking up cables, start with ground, go to neutral, then go live.  
As a result of how line power works,  
Neutral SHOULD be reference to Ground at the line, with Live reference to Neutral,  
This assumption means it's considered SLIGHTLY safer than Live in an ideal circuit,  
So plug in Ground, then plug in Neutral, then plug in Live.  
Got it?  
Not that you will ever deal with an ideal circuit,  
and not that you should EVER handle line voltage,  
but if you don't want to be in the Ground, start with Neutral to stay aLive.  
Do not allow a current path to form through your body,  
but if it is to happen on accident, make sure it is not across your chest.  
Your chest is where your sensitive heart lives,  
and introducing current to your heart makes it beat wrong and you die.  
This being said, almost everything I am playing with on this channel is not AC,  
and when it is, it is going through a step-down transformer,  
so it is not Live at Line voltage.  
I highly suggest using batteries as your power source,  
because they can only put out so much power before they're empty,  
whereas your electrical socket is hooked up to more power than your body has room for.

So remember those 2 main things:  
Ground, Neutral, Live, in that order,  
and no current path through your body.

Next up, we will talk about basic components and how to read a basic circuit diagram,  
but for right now, that is all.
