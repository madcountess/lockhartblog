Ahoy hoy! I'm Luna, the People's Bayonet, that's peoplesbayo.net, comin' at you as-live from occupied Georgia!  
My Friends, My Family, My Fellow New Southerners, Subscribers Big and Small,

How can I encourage you to read, engage with, and apply theory? that is, how can I get you to use the principles of scientific socialism to organize locally? What is the roadblock? in my viewpoint, it's largely a misunderstanding of the purpose of theory, and a trust in those who deride theory to be doing so in good faith and in good understanding. This leads to people reading less theory for themselves.

Let me tell you a story about myself, what I used to follow and believe, and how my views have changed, even as recently as this year. Then, I'll outline some plans for local action now that I've moved. I want to tell you how I got from a position of complaint to a position of action, because I think that journey is kinda interesting.

I grew up going to church, but was never forced to go. I never really bought in on the divine, but the deeds of Christ compelled me, they've basically molded my values and my worldview since childhood. I wish to teach, I wish to provide, I wish to free the oppressed, and I wish for the world to unite in peace. I learned that bigotry is wrong from the songs about Jesus, I learned of the importance of providing for the needy from bible study, I learned how to love my neighbor as myself from sunday school, I learned how to serve my community from the afterschool program. I was involved in church stuff all the way up until I was a legal adult, being told all about how Jesus Christ was a model for life. Now, I can't deny that my worldview has changed quite a bit, but I still call myself an atheist *Christian*, because I understand where my values originated.  

In 2008, my first year voting, I voted for Obama. His message of Hope was compelling, Hope and Change! I was idealistic. I thought we could just convince enough people to get the right people in office to get the right legislation passed to help out lower and middle class people, as I then called them. we lost our house less than a year later.  
by 2010, the democrats had stalled on getting anything promised done, the tea party was in full effect, I watched the bully pulpit go from squandered to nonexistant, and I began to recognize a flaw in the Democratic Party.  
In 2012, after 2 more years of relative inaction, I reluctantly voted for Obama again, because Romney seemed marginally worse I guess? They sounded so similar that I lashed out at someone for asking me to explain why I'm voting for Obama. I was no longer compelled by his messaging, so I looked to other politicians like Bernie Sanders in 2014 when I found his speeches on youtube. He made me wonder why all politicians weren't like him. I voted for democrats again, but I can't even remember that election.  
In 2016 I got to vote for Bernie! Then I watched the DNC completely sabotage Bernie's campaign, and it turned me sour against the Democrats for good.  
I wrote a journal entry in 2016 that I have put on my site, and it illustrates how I felt at the time: quote
"Hillary lost. Trump won. And people are complaining about Russians. This country has serious issues…

Well, I have some thoughts about this election, now that it’s all over, and it feels like this outcome was inevitable. The Democrats were greedy, Bernie Sanders made a valiant effort, but it wasn’t enough to break the Democratic National Committee. Sanders’ messaging hit home for a lot of younger folks, like myself, and positioned himself as the positive, perhaps reformist, anti-establishment candidate. Trump’s messaging hit home for a lot of working class folks, like myself, and positioned himself as the negative, perhaps destructive, anti-establishment candidate. The Democrats went with Hillary Clinton. This is why they lost.  
If Trump is as bad as they say he is, it’s going to be their fault, their greed, their incalculable incompetence at making a dent in the armor around the hearts and minds of millions that is going to be responsible for him being in office. Trump’s campaign was a trainwreck. MSM couldn’t look away. Millions in free advertising for every weird thing Trump did. Now what? Well, we keep working, maybe tomorrow will be brighter if we light a beacon for freedom, so, grab a match."
unquote  

I should note that "reformist" was used positively there... like I said, I've changed a lot since then, but 2017 is where my transformation really begins. That was the first year I called myself an anarchist, the first year I took things seriously, and the first year that I recognized that we cannot rely on the democrats. I knew for a fact that we needed a worker run world! I committed myself to... anarcho-syndicalism.  
Anarcho-syndicalism is the ideology of the General Strike, in essence, as THE tool of revolution. It's promoted by unionist liberals like Chomsky, it's parodied by liberalist clowns like Musk, and it was my first choice because I grew up a union gal and a bit of a liberal.
I feel for anarcho-syndicalists, I believe their hearts to be in the right place, and I believe their methods to be fairly effective at achieving reform, but I believe they make a fatal logistical error. A General Strike is a powerful weapon, but with declining union membership and increasing automation, it looks like a weapon we don't have the strength to load, much less fire. We have absurdly high unemployed and underemployed rates, and that itself puts a breach in our armor.
As written by good old Karl Marx in Wage Labor and Capital (great book, you should read it):

there is competition between the buyers and the sellers of labor: employers wish to pay as little in wages as possible, and workers wish to receive as much in wages as possible. The result of this competition will depend on the strength of each industrial army. quote "Industry leads two great armies into the field against each-other, and each of these again is engaged in a battle among its own troops in its own ranks. The army among whose troops there is less fighting, carries off the victory." unquote.  
When the supply of workers outstrips the demand for labor, owners have little reason to pay fair wages, and wages can remain depressed. The supply of workers is nearly neverending, and the unemployed, poor, and starving are the army of workers' most desperate. The owners can and will employ this desperate reserve to increase competition within the army of workers.  

[Kellogg's attempted to replace 1400 union members instead of doing anything to satisfy the demands of the strikers,][KE1] (KE1) and clever people on the internet, but especially the spontaneous-consciousness-loving r/antiwork on reddit started breaking their recruitment efforts by extra-legal means, the scabs were doing their part by doing a poor job, it was basically a nightmare for Kellogg's. Basically, everything went right for the labor struggle, and what did they get? What legislation was put into place to satisfy the demands of the strikers? They got... a better contract. Granted, yes, that's good, wins are necessary for cultivating the fighting spirit, but where the spirit runs into limits, it requires extra-labor action. It can't just be Strikes and Protests, it needs to be General Strikes and Political Activity. We need to have structures in place to gather people to act in service of the community in ways that capitalism does not. We need structures in place to fight for working families, for the American working class to the exclusion of the American owning class.

we're losing right now, that's what's happening with the American working class. we're making headway, if you've seen the spontaneous walk-outs going on, but they are having little success in getting demands met. The organized strikes like the fantastic one at Kellogg's are having some success with work-related demands, but ultimately those demands are legally limited to work demands within specific bounds, and even unions can only go on strike so long before they have to go back to work, because the business can outlast the worker. we have to be able to lose without losing composure, which means that we can't fly at each-others' throats over trivial nonsense.

2018 I saw the democratic socialists join the house and by 2019 I had seen them subsumed completely by the democrats. I can't remember how disappointed I was, because I have resigned myself to being disappointed by democrats by this point in time.  

2019, I started this channel with a series called "The Problem" in which I played the part of someone who wasn't really familiar with theory, but wanted to be a revolutionary anyway.
By the end of 2019, I no longer agreed with myself at the beginning of 2019.

2020 was mostly just catatonic crisis mode. you see, I originally joined youtube to be a part of Breadtube, which I now find to be both a toxic subreddit and a spectacle that goes against a significant portion of my values. I had to re-evaluate my relationship with the Online Left, and by the time november 2020 rolled around, I was pretty much done with self-identified anarchists on the internet.  

I watched the Black Lives Matter protests become bigger and louder and more demands were being made, and demands for fewer demands were made. We had demands for abolition of the police, the abolition of all state power, the abolition of this, that, or the other, and not a single meaningful reform even came out of the purely spontaneous movement. Organization attempted to reign in the beast, but the energy was expended, the next president had been selected, and so the protests died down, and things went back to normal.  
We absolutely cannot rely on the spontaneous element alone, we need better organizing, and it can't just be focused on the workplace, it needs to be focused on affecting change through building power and meeting the needs of the community today rather than trying to just make the revolution happen somehow, by sheer force of will, with "the idea is the thing" at the center of action.  

the DNC did more shady shit to Bernie, but I don't care anymore, I spoke out about Biden before he was elected and got called a fascist sympathizer for being a principled anarchist. I wasn't gonna bow down to the Democratic Party, I wasn't going to let individualist arguments overwhelm my collectivist outlook. I made observations about how, after the 1/6 riots, a lot of so-called anarchists were calling for snitching to the FBI about people involved in that riot, and that that is a bad thing, and got called a fascist sympathizer again, for being a principled anarchist again.

2021 is shaping up to have been a momentous year for me. I've moved house, I'm getting surgery soon, I started up a new series called New South Radio to try to broaden my reach slightly, and note a distinct break in how I look at the world from the person I was when I started The Problem. I had no idea how to resolve the contradictions in what I had been teaching, and 2021 is when I picked up theory.  

I barely recognize my positions in 2019. I still hold a few of them, but the places where I disagree with myself yank at my skin. I probably wouldn't be as harsh about anarchists if I hadn't've been one so recently and still feel betrayed by the impulses that lead me to those positions. When I picked up Theory, I started with Kropotkin, Malatesta, and Goldman, but I found my way to Marx and Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, X, King, Hampton, Nkrumah, Ture, Rashid, etc. etc. and I understand a lot more about what's going on than I used to. I was angry with myself for not picking up on this stuff earlier, but much more angry with people who just yell "read theory!" as if that's gonna reach anybody, or who deride and misrepresent theory as just words of long dead people who don't matter.  
Theory is the principles of scientific socialism. It's the results of experiments, it's hypotheses for future experiments, and it's discussion about what we're building. Some of it is written over-academically, but a lot of even the old stuff is pretty accessible. Without theory, practice will falter, and without practice, theory will languish.

I know who is in my audience, there's not many of you, but some of you want to be community educators like I do. and I want you to keep that in mind. Someone who eventually found education in theory was initially turned off of theory by people who fetishize theory, but refuse to apply it, and by people who deride theory, but refuse to read it.
there need to be more bridges, that means building them, not burning them. if you simply want to burn shit down, you are not my comrade. if you simply want to tear people down, you are not my comrade. If all that matters to you is destruction and competition, you should change the channel, because you are not my comrade.  
The anarchists I talk to on a regular basis tend not to be that type, but on occasion, I meet someone who appears to desire for the collapse of society outright, or someone who has nothing on their minds but vitriol over old pointless drama. I have tried to stay off twitter, because twitter has the worst version of everything, and internet-poisoned liberals have taken to calling themselves anarchists, which paints a distorted view of what anarchism is. So, I'm sorry to the principled anarchists for focusing my anger on self-ID anarchists at times. if you're a principled anarchist, or if you read theory, we probably argue but we'd probably still get along. I don't have problems with principled anarchists, I used to be one, but I've been under attack for breaking with my previous orthodox. I've gotten the ridiculous epithets Tankie, Nazbol, and Class Reductionist, as I've already said a few times before, but I should've focused my ire on the existential threat to anything that could approach a mass movement inside the imperial core: Imperialism, just the same as anywhere else in the world.  
Whatever this liberal shit is that's calling itself anarchism on the internet can piss off. I'm no longer a Syndicalist, I'm no longer pushing Anarchism, I am a Holist, and I'm pushing Communism. That means I think we need a government of action to fight for working families, a government that will prioritize public good and economic development rather than the profits of a private few. I agree with the conclusion that we need a transitional government. I don't think we can jump straight to the end. Communism should be a positive word for you, and you should make it a positive word for those you talk to. If you're going to be educating people about the labor struggle, you absolutely need a theoretical basis that goes beyond "the idea is the thing."  

quote Lenin in What is to be Done "[...] the “spontaneous element”, in essence, represents nothing more nor less than consciousness in an embryonic form. Even the primitive revolts expressed the awakening of consciousness to a certain extent. The workers were losing their age-long faith in the permanence of the system which oppressed them and began... I shall not say to understand, but to sense the necessity for collective resistance, definitely abandoning their slavish submission to the authorities. But this was, nevertheless, more in the nature of outbursts of desperation and vengeance than of struggle." unquote  

we're seeing this same shit right now, we have these big events that are spontaneous and loud, but lack discipline, and as such lack direction and aim, which I guess brings us back to "how do I get y'all to read, engage with, and apply theory?"
it's very clear to workers that shit's fucked up, clearly, look how many walkouts there are, look at the "Labor Shortage" narrative, look at the strikes, look at the amount of anticapitalist media that exists, they don't just need anticapitalist media tho. they need real re-education. It's not enough to accurately describe the worker-owner relationship, you must understand the whole of the problem to understand the whole of the problem. It's a tautology, but without trying to educate, the people you're reaching will not learn.  

We can either accept that we are not immune to propaganda, and we can construct robust defenses and make our own, or, we can just repeat "I am not immune to propaganda" while feverishly buying into and repeating liberalist propaganda. This is one of the main reasons I broke off from Breadtube at the end of 2020, the individualist, anarchist, idealist, and utopian crowd turned against me for bringing up how they're repeating cold war era anticommunist propaganda.

Quote Lenin again, "But why, the reader will ask, does the spontaneous movement, the movement along the line of least resistance, lead to the domination of [liberalist] ideology? For the simple reason that [liberalist] ideology is far older in origin than socialist ideology, that it is more fully developed, and that it has at its disposal immeasurably more means of dissemination." unquote.  
we talk about how liberalist ideology is accepted en masse by the working class and it makes sense why we're discouraged from thinking about the framework in which we operate, and encouraged to think more of the spontaneous "struggle" which is, in fact, a spectacle. a performance. Spontaneous action lends itself to recuperation by liberalist ideology, so of course those without a social-scientific background would have MORE issues achieving consciousness.  
The spontaneous "struggle" takes place mostly in the form of protest, but protest is inadequate. Protest is catharsis, because it feels good to tell someone to fuck off. I would argue that protest is not only inadequate in terms of action, but also inadequate in terms of education and organization. If you go to a protest, you should be recruiting for organization. "for what organization, though!?" the unorganized masses cry out, well, for the ones you help run, the ones you start, the ones you join, you should be building networks of local contacts, and you should be educating about the practical tasks and material conditions, because we cannot rely on mass media or social media for everything.  
I'll be putting my "Money" where my Mouth is on this, specifics to come, but I've got a reading / study group coming up, I'm going to be talking more to them about what our focus will be on, but one of our tasks will be recruiting from protests. Why protests? It's a high concentration of disaffected people, easy resource for an organizer to delve into. These people are more likely to want to "do the work" and are less likely to value their free time more than they value affecting change.  
I've seen talk, in the books and articles that I'm reading, of the Mass Movement of Revolutionary Fervor. We have the fervor, but why don't we have the movement? why don't we have a mass movement? I mean, I have a pretty good idea why: America is built on the glorification of revolution, while teaching nothing of the theory and practice of revolution. There's unfinished business here, and those in control are aware of that fact. We have to be able to harness that energy.
I know a lot of y'all ain't organizers and don't want to be organizers, but I am determined to be a teacher, and to teach, I must organize a class. I guess we'll see how that all pans out so... wish me luck. I know The State's track record when it comes to organizers.

"if you think large scale production and distribution cannot be organized via the free and equal association of the producers, then you're not a communist or a marxist." So. If you think that the marketplace and the anarchy of production are two of the main issues of capitalism, you are not a communist or a marxist......... ok. so that's a lie. They're referring to "Origins of the Family" here, and they're doing the classic "Engels was actually an anarchist" trick when literally marxism requires seizure of the means of production and of organization as a state, and it's not like we can skip to the... see, this is what I'm talking about. It's a willful misinterpretation of theory to push wrong ideas and wrong actions.
