Stacy's Running Again
What Her Org Claims
What Her Org Does
Stacy Claims BDS is Anti-Semitic
Acknowledges BDS is an anti-apartheid tactic
Israel is an Apartheid State that has been attempting to project the image that anything anti-israel is anti-semitic, so, something with methodological issues like BDS gets railed as anti-semitic, when there are legitimate criticisms of the BDS movement.
Complaints about demands and scope
praise over method
Stacy wouldn't look that far into it though, because, as she says "georgia is a friend of israel" \*spit*
this is even before we get to her organization's campaign contributions, like a contribution to the senate campaigns of 2 new democrats... that was not even the maximum donation, and a wild overly complicated donation to the chef's union that beefed with bernie in 2020... the ONLY donation, in fact.

Make sure to subscribe, and go to people's bayonet, that's peoplesbayo.net for sources and transcript as well as ways to fund this operation.  
to a working unity, my friends, solidarity forever. âœŠ
