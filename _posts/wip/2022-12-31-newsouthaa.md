Ahoy hoy! I'm Luna, the People's Bayonet, that's peoplesbayo.net, comin' at you as-live from occupied Georgia!  
My Friends, My Family, My Fellow New Southerners, Subscribers Big and Small,

You there! Lost soul! Come in, out of the rain, come in out of the cold, come in out of the drudge and misery of work in the modern day, come in, and let us give you purpose.
Your life has felt, at times, purposeless, yes?
at times, were you told to turn towards the church or the parties of the ruling class, yes? at times, you considered it, entertained it, and maybe even indulged it, yes?
but the purpose given by most organized religions is false.
the purpose given by the owning class is always a false one.
If there is a god, I was taught to fight for the downtrodden masses against rich oppressors.
If there is no god, I was taught to fight for the downtrodden masses against the owning class.



Will you pick up the mantle and fight for the downtrodden masses with me, friend?

Make sure to subscribe, and go to people's bayonet, that's peoplesbayo.net for sources and transcript as well as ways to fund this operation.  
to a working unity, my friends, solidarity forever. âœŠ
