Ahoy hoy! I'm Luna, the People's Bayonet, that's peoplesbayo.net, comin' at you as-live from occupied Georgia!  
My Friends, My Family, My Fellow New Southerners, Subscribers Big and Small, we've gotta talk about Union Activity, Antitrust Law, and Nationalization today, so let's start first with Union Activity.

## Union Activity

The National Labor Relations Board, NLRB, is a federal agency that has 26 regions across the united states. Each of these regional offices is tasked with handling labor disputes and ensuring proper protocol, and Region 10 oversees the labor relations of Georgia, Kentucky, and Alabama. Region 10 just ordered United Mine Workers to pay 13.3 million dollars to cover "lost profits" incurred by the owners of the mines due to the work stoppages. That is to say that over the past 16 months, Warrior Met claims that strikes have cost them 13.3 million dollars, and the NLRB is fining the union for this loss.

The point of work stoppages is to hurt the owners' bottom line, because that's the bargaining chip that workers have in a labor dispute, so workers being charged for the intentional damage they're doing will have a chilling effect on strikes inside the united states, and/or it will escalate court battles over fines issued to unions for striking.

that's kinda an issue, in a time where strikes are happening more often in a period of low activity, because it hampers organizing efforts. If we cannot legally act without incurring heavy fines, then we will have to stick to... well, illegal work

There will be an escalation in rhetoric, there will be an escalation in action, there will be an escalation in legal retaliation against direct action, and there will be direct state crackdown as soon as things get too rowdy

this is not to discourage, I hope I am not discouraging, it's just to prepare for what tends to happen in these situations

The United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) announced today that it will appeal the dismissal by National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) Region 10 of several unfair labor practice charges relating to vehicular assault by Warrior Met Coal management personnel. The NLRB said there was “insufficient evidence that any pickets were struck” despite both video evidence and eyewitness testimony.

since this has been going on, there have been scenes of violence against strikers that mimick that of the Private Military Force hired by Rockefeller in Ludlow, striking workers have been harassed and hit with cars, and now, 16 months into the strike, they're being charged with damages. There's a concerted effort against the working people of America from Imperial-Capitalists and their Capital-State, including the intensely bourgeois NLRB that has ruled against labor more and more in recent years

## Antitrust

hell, even things that are meant to protect us from the greed of the owning class, like Antitrust, are used against Labor. Labor Action has exemptions from antitrust legislaiton, but if they step out of line, they can be sued for antitrust violations. They're technically removing competition in the labor market, so they have to walk a particularly thin line. It's essentially why you can't force a non-union employer to hire union, and it's why you can't join a union to a non-union organization.

Legal unions in the US cannot be revolutionary, it's illegal.

When I say phrases like "legal and illegal work" or "work that must be done in and outside the legal framework," I'm talking about work you have to do outside of legally sanctioned unions with the people who are inside of those legally sanctioned unions (and outside workers)

an antitrust lawsuit brought forward against the NFL in 1996 by the player's union ruled in favor of the owners enshrining owners' collective non-union actions as being legally protected, while workers' collective non-union actions are not, because the latter is anti-competitive.

the capital-state will never bow to union power, because union power is regulated by the capital-state. Unless we start doing work outside the legal system with the people we're joined with within the legal system, we're gonna have a hard time fighting back with labor power alone. This is a large part of why having a non-union organization like a party or similar is a good idea, so long as the union is not officially joined with the party.

a part of the point of seizing political power as well as gaining control over the means of production is to kneecap the ability of the owning class to regulate our collective power, and to prevent them from collectivizing their power to overtake the working class, and once again steal from us what we have built, and what rightfully belongs to us

## Nationalization

One of the many tools we have at our disposal is Nationalization, which is when the state takes control of a company or industry to publicly own and (hopefully) publicly operate

but like... I dunno. this is a part of the problem I have with the Labor movement in the United States. Either it has to openly advocate for illegal unions or it has to play along with legal organizing, the former of which hasn't materialized in any meaningful capacity, and it seems that a lot of the loudest voices are leaning hard into the latter

As for revolutionary activity, it appears that the US state is cracking down on anything that appears too revolutionary. Black Hammer, though I disagree with them, recently got raided by SWAT and the leader was arrested as a Cult Leader.

and for another, the African People's Socialist Party, APSP, was raided by the FBI recently in another example of the capital-state's repression. They are being accused of collaboration with Russia because they oppose NATO aggression in Ukraine, which is an attack that has been lobbed at all sorts of communists who oppose the war in Ukraine, because it's an easy scapegoat to pretend like Putin controls anti-imperialist communists in the US, because the Cold War never ended

these are the types of escalations we should expect

COINTELPRO never died, the Cold War never ended, and Ronald Reagan is still alive

or at least his legacy is

what's the point I'm trying to make here?

I think it's clear that the capital-state will do anything it needs to to disrupt revolutionary organization, even misguided revolutionary organization, because communism is a threat to capitalism

fascism isn't much of a threat to capitalism, so there's not much disruption of fascist organizations, but communism is.

after the communists in the 30s were the most effective union organizers in the entire country, there was a lot of incentive to suppress both

do we need to be ready to defend ourselves? do we need to be able to fight back? does this mean that action takes precedence over organization and education? I don't know yet. Just gonna be honest, my grasp of theory breaks down at this point, and I'm still learning from those who came before me and those who are still doing the work today

but it's clear to me that expecting legal unions to be revolutionary is a mistake we should be more careful not to make. As I said earlier, they can't be revolutionary, it's illegal

and we can't expect not to get suppressed in non-union activity, because boy howdy is that gonna happen
