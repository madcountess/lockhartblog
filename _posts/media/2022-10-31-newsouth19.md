Ahoy hoy! I'm Luna, the People's Bayonet, that's peoplesbayo dot net, comin' at you as-live from occupied Georgia!  
My Friends, My Family, My Fellow New Southerners, Subscribers Big and Small, we have to talk about Legal-Unionism and continue our discussion from the previous in this short series on Antitrust. To begin with, we're gonna look at a few more court cases that helped define labor law in the United States.

In 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act was passed, making illegal "Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations." As I said last episode, this does, in fact, include unions.



Just a couple years after the Sherman Act was passed, the first anti-labor antitrust case was brought forward against the former crew of the Violante. the Steam Ship Violante ferried goods between New Orleans and Liverpool, and the crew became unhappy with being unpaid for docked days and abandoned ship the morning they were to leave port. The Violante's Captain tried to get another crew, but the original crew intimidated away any potential replacements until the court issued an injunction against the original crew for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act because goods from New Orleans could not make it back to Liverpool, therefore international trade is being restricted by this agreement between members of a crew quitting their jobs and scaring off replacements.



In the same court, one month later, a case was brought forward against the Workingmen's Amalgamated Council of New Orleans alleging that their combination of unions was such that, given the port status of New Orleans, interstate and international trade were being restricted, and as such, the valiant workers of the 1892 New Orleans General Strike (which is a video on its own) were sued by the government under the Sherman Antitrust Act. This set precedence for cases involving port unions for about 20 years until the passing of the Clayton Act, which both enshrined Unions as Legal and set very strict limits on what Unions can do Legally.



The Clayton act was passed in 1914 and clarified what is and is not allowed under antitrust law. It starts with the fantastic sentiment “The labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce.” This implies that labor should not be held to the same regulations as commodities and articles of commerce. Regardless of the fantastic sentiment, antitrust still applies to unions, but, the Clayton Act made some key exceptions that essentially allowed unions to bargain for pay and conditions with their workplace without being in violation of antitrust, and with it came protections for the collective bargaining process itself.

In 1921, however, the court case of Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering set the precedent that "secondary" or "solidarity" or "sympathy" strikes, in which unions in other businesses or industries go on strike in support of a striking union, were not exempt from antitrust law, and allowed the court to once again issue injunctions to halt union activity that got out of line.

In 1941, the court case of US v Hutcheson further restricted union activity, defining that Union Activity must consist of actions in the quote "union's self-interest," which means no secondary strikes, and no protesting to force un-unionized workplaces to hire union or go out of business, and that it must not be joined in any way with non-union organizations. Unions must fight for themselves, themselves only, and they can't do anything too scary.

Those two restricted application of the protections in the clayton act, rendering it no more than a fantastic sentiment that is technically in the law books. As I mentioned at the end of the last video, the Clayton Act was called by AFL's Samuel Gompers "Labor's Magna Carta." This is because it enshrined the bargaining process into law, but to talk about why this compliment means very little in the modern era, I have to talk about the AFL and the CIO.



the AFL, or the American Federation of Labor, was founded in 1886. the AFL used to be known as the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions of the United States of America and Canada or FOTLUUSAC from 1881-1886. No wonder they went with AFL. As a combination of craft unions who sought mutual support, following the collapse of the Knights of Labor, the to-be AFL was founded with the help of Samuel Gompers. Gompers was THE union man, and he was elected president of the AFL at its founding and every election since then, barring one, before his death in 1924. It continues on in its combination with the CIO as the AFL-CIO. I will get to the AFL-CIO. Originally, the AFL did not admit women or people of color, and strictly stayed out of politics, as Gompers thought it would offend business owners and make the bargaining process more difficult. So, the AFL had some foundational issues that were somewhat pervasive.

The biggest issue that the AFL had though, is that they only admitted quote-unquote "skilled workers" and would not represent a union of "unskilled workers." This means that AFL was slash is promoting craft unionism, and refusing the call of industrial unionism, which I believe was a major misstep.

Despite their restrictive policies, the AFL unionized many workplaces, and were lauded as a success by the american labor movement in obtaining fairer conditions and pay. Their refusal to interfere in politics is, I think, the biggest mistake in this, because on top of fairer conditions and fairer pay, we could be demanding fairer laws, we could be demanding enforcement of laws on huge employers, we could be joining with non-union organizations to build power for systemic change.

Gompers and the AFL fought to end Yellow Dog contracts, which required an employee to not seek union membership or be terminated. These contracts were very commonplace in response to the rise in legal-unionism, but, in 1932, the Norris-Laguardia act was passed, outlawing Yellow Dog contracts. This was absolutely a win in the legal-unionist fight, and gave representation to many workers who would otherwise be on their own.

The National Labor Relations Act, otherwise known as the Wagner Act, was signed into law in 1935. The National Labor Relations Board, NLRB, was established to oversee elections for union representation and investigate unfair labor practices. It forbids discrimination against union-members and plaintiffs alike, and guarantees the right to organize and act as a union in the private sector. The NLRB has a bit of a track record of ruling against unions when they step even slightly out of line, though, and recently they ruled against mineworkers in the southeast who went on strike for 16 months, and who were met with violence from the police and private contractors, to the tune of 13.3 Million Dollars in damages as a result of work stoppage.

the period following the Wagner act saw a lot of wins for labor, Starting with the formation of the CIO. Following the death of Gompers, many members were advocating for the AFL to open up their ranks to the "unskilled laborers" and unionize workplaces that provide some of the biggest profits to the owning class. This group of people was the Committee for Industrial Organization.



The Committee for Industrial Organization, founded in 1935, was an organization of, to begin with, 10 unions that were a part of the AFL. After trying to change policy to allow unskilled laborers and integrated workplaces, all 10 unions were expelled from the AFL to form the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the CIO.

The CIO increased the ranks of "unskilled" unions across the nation, including many integrated workplaces, and gave a voice to the voiceless masses, advocating for unions that cover entire industries and not just specific crafts. One of the biggest successes was actually prior to their split with the AFL. In 1936, workers at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio went on strike to protest the conditions and pay at the factory. They staged a sit-in to prevent scabs from taking their jobs while they strike, while forming impressive picket lines outside the factory to generate publicity and further hold off scabs, until the police were called in. Upon arriving, the police refused to cross the picket line due to the sheer number of angry workers they were faced with, and Goodyear eventually gave in, allowing the formation of United Rubber Workers, a labor union of "unskilled" workers, something Gompers would've hated to see.

The CIO continued their hard work until 1955, for reasons I will get into, when they were reabsorbed by the AFL to become the AFL-CIO. The main problem with the AFL-CIO is that they're the AFL in spirit and the CIO in membership, which leads to political interference (mostly in favor of Democrats), and a complete disconnect with the average American worker. I'm, clearly, not a fan of the AFL-CIO, so let's move on before I get to slander.

The CIO supported New Deal programs by then-president Roosevelt, as they helped to empower unions in the south, which means that a lot of "unskilled" and integrated workplaces were unionizing, especially after the outbreak of World War 2. Some New Deal programs still exist today, but many were dismantled by reaction soon afterwards, and Union Power took one of the biggest hits it's ever taken thanks to the Taft-Hartley Act.



The Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, better known as the Taft-Hartley Act, was passed in reaction to an economic downturn during the war, which conservatives blamed on the power of unions. It sought to limit the power of unions by creating "right to work" laws, which, if you've heard about before, you know they're bad news for unions. Essentially, right-to-work laws enable employers to circumvent unions to hire non-union employees in unionized workplaces, causing union membership to plummet, and union power to go down with it.



Right now, the only real protections that Labor has in its fight against Capital are designed to enable craft-unionism and discourage industrial-unionism, and those protections are cut to the stencil set by antitrust, so, we have to ask the question, I think: "does antitrust spark joy?" that is, is it doing what it says it's doing? is it doing more good than harm? Or, maybe, more importantly, is the Era of Legal-Unionism Over?

As I'll define it, the era of Legal-Unionism started with the formation of the AFL under the leadership of Samuel Gompers, and became mainstreamed in large part in 1914 with the passage of the Clayton Act. The era ended in 1955 when the CIO ceded the ground it had fought to maintain since the passage of the Taft-Hartley act in 1947, and rejoined the AFL.

The problem with my definition is that the era of Legal-Unionism is not over yet, so much as it's the only thing allowed to exist under the capital-state in its permanently hobbled form, gaining minor victories here and there, but never again shifting the landscape as they were once able to do.



I think the only remaining solution for union advocates is to advocate for Illegal-Unionism, where we refuse to pay fines to the NLRB, and we take up the mantle of hardcore badasses like Eugene Debs and flaunt injunctions filed against strike action.

To wit, my favorite Antitrust vs Labor lawsuit: US v. Debs.

In 1894, Rail workers, union and not, were compelled to refuse to carry Pullman cars. These were known as the Pullman Strikes, and as in the case of US v. Workingmen's Amalgamated Council of New Orleans et al and Blindell v. Hagan, this meant that interstate and international trade were being interrupted, which meant that a court could issue an injunction against the strikers to force them to work.

Sidebar, isn't that slavery? Just sayin.

Well, Eugene Debs and the Strikers just kinda gave the middle finger to the courts and kept striking, which lead to US v Debs soon after, where the strike leaders and debs were indicted on contempt of court and sent to jail.

I mean it IS a pretty badass reason to be held in contempt of court, not gonna lie, but... that's kinda the end-game for unionism in the United States, isn't it? Flaunting the rules and going to jail? We can battle it out in the courts, but they've proven to be hostile to unions. We can seek higher representation with the biggest union in the land, the AFL-CIO, but then we have to acquiesce to their agenda, and limit strike action.

I think what's over is the hayday of industrial-unionism, legal or illegal, either the CIO variety or the IWW variety. There will be no one-big-union without it being strictly against the law, which, godspeed soldier, but I don't think that's a particularly realistic goal when the state of the labor movement in these United States is as recuperated and destroyed as it is.

We will still need to do work, legal and illegal, if we want a worker's movement to build here. That much is beyond question. The question at hand is the methods of attaining our goal, and I'm much more in favor of non-union organizations being incorporated with unions to allow the growth of a revolutionary organization of workers pulled from the masses organized in unions and disorganized by Right To Work and other such legal hullabaloo

If you want to see how Legal-Unionism exists today, I would suggest reading No Shortcuts by Jane McAlevey, as she goes over how the organizing process works for legal unions in the US. The red tape you have to cut through, the fact that, if you're a union organizer, in many states, you cannot under any circumstances enter the business you're trying to organize.

that's bonkers, straight up nonsense, and if the era of Industrial-Unionism is over, then, what's left but revolution?



In part 3 of, hopefully, 3, I will be talking about solutions to antitrust, monopolies, and unions, by talking about a specific case in which we almost had nationalized telephones, 2 specific cases in which we almost had nationalized rail, and how nationalization might work under a worker-state as one prong of the solution to The Accumulation of Capital.
