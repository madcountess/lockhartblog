GOD BLESS  
America!  
BLESS its troubled soul  
Bless this wretched mess,  
this god forsaken bloodied hole!  
With BLOOD on the ground,  
BLOOD in the air,  
and BLOOD in our memories  
rising up from fertile soil this trinity will work its wonders in the workers of the world!  
god BLESS  
America  
Bless these pillaged lands!  
Watch our fallow crops and fields as they all fall to sands  
of time we wasted bickering about the poison in our tanks  
and planes we use to murder people FOR THAT POISON!  
We gotta change our mode  
can I get a AMEN!  
I SAID CAN *clap* I GET A AMEN!?  
We forsake the knowledge of those who came before us,  
we forsake the power of community while touting  
heh  
"Family Values?"  
We forsake the wonder working power in the blood of the worker.  
power  
I said POWER!  
WONDER-WORKING POWER  
in the blood  
of the land.  
Deliver us from evil, my friends  
The System does not work for us, but it is working perfectly  
deliver us from harm  
there's no HOPE for the system to CHANGE  
the SYSTEM that we serve  
deliver us from hellish tyrants, bring them to their ends  
[the courts][01] (01)  
[and congress,][02] (02)  
[presidency,][03] (03)  
gears of progress rusted to a halt by rich oppressors who have nothing but disgust, disdain,  
DESTROY their domain!  
DELIVER US  
from our own blades, my friends  
For justice.  
For all.  
Black Lives Matter  
Queer Lives Matter  
Indigenous Lives Matter  
Disabled Lives Matter  
you can cop out by sayin' ALL lives matter, but the truth is?  
No Lives Matter  
Until Disabled Lives Matter.  
No Lives Matter  
Until Indigenous Lives Matter  
No Lives Matter  
Until Queer Lives Matter  
No Lives Matter  
Until Black Lives Matter  
I said NO  
LIVES MATTER  
UNTIL OUR  
LIVES MATTER!  

We stand, as the leper, at Lazarus' front gate  
And we can stand here and beg  
[We can hope the rich give us scraps][04] (04)  
[We can hope we aren't destroyed by this disease][05] (05)  
[We can HOPE for CHANGE][06] (06)  
Or we can skip being nice to rich oppressors and take it all BACK!  
For  
The People  
For  
The Community  
For  
Humanity  
FOR THERE is POWER  
WONDER-working POWER  
in the BLOOD  
of THE PEOPLE  
GOD  
BLESS  
America.  
My home sweet home.  
And god bless us all.  
Amen.
