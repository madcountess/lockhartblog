in copyright law, there is a doctrine frequently applied and used as a sort of judicial template called "fair use"  
in short, we have to determine how transformative a work is and how much of the original work comprises the end product.  
[Law lays out a strict line][01] (01) outside which, copyright infringement is happening,  
but the other side of that line is a smooth gradient into "clearly not copyright infringement" territory.  
As such, the lines of "transformative enough" are included in that gradient until hammered into place  
by corporate rules and precidential law, rather than logical conclusions.  
It's a philosophical paradox, rather than a puzzle of reasoning.  
TO WIT!

[This is Sonic the Hedgehog,](https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(Sonic_X))  
he is owned by Sega as Intellectual Property

[This is Sonic in a costume,](https://www.deviantart.com/hynotama/art/Sonic-Adventure-2-Sonic-Dreamcast-Alt-Costume-563552004)  
it's an official image, is this still sonic?

[This is Sonic in a shirt, it's fan-generated, but is it still sonic?](https://www.deviantart.com/nibroc-rock/art/Sonic-in-Jacky-Bryant-Outfit-613010121)  
could sega claim this image to be of their character "Sonic the Hedgehog?"

[This is Sonic in a costume with some extra hair up front,](https://www.deviantart.com/darkhedgehog23/art/Runnic-the-hybird-BIO-update-2014-436204291)    
could this still be considered a recognizable image of sonic?

[This is sonic with black eyes and red irises.](https://www.deviantart.com/jetfox89/art/Sonic-EXE-Sonic-06-Version-673282726)  
is this a sonic?

[how about with wings?](https://www.deviantart.com/banjo2015/art/Wing-Sonic-563173570)

[how about without shoes- ](https://www.deviantart.com/feetymcfoot/art/3D-Sonic-the-barefoot-Hedgehog-629064540)  
oh god skip SKIP

[or a girl? is she a sonic?](https://www.deviantart.com/joyoiyoi/art/Female-Sonic-534263768)  
certainly she isn't identical, but she's still recognizably a sonic

[recolors? is this sonic still a sonic?](https://www.deviantart.com/sasukechidori212/art/Black-Sonic-The-Hedgehog-336712341)  
or is this transformative enough to no longer be sonic?

[recolors with clothing changes, and some hair changes,](https://www.deviantart.com/flippyfan456/art/Zero-the-Artificial-Hedgehog-510474193)  
but I wouldn't be able to tell you that this isn't a sonic without you being dubious of my claim

[now, with a full costume, color changes, hair changes.](https://www.deviantart.com/sikathesoul/art/Shadow-the-hedgehog-form-574792462)  
is this still a sonic? what are the falsifying conditions?

[this is that same character in official images, he's known as shadow the hedgehog,](https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_the_Hedgehog)  
a clearly different character also owned by Sega, but is this also a sonic?  
even though canon says this isn't sonic, it is a hedgehog character owned by sega  
that resembles many fan art depictions of characters very clearly imitating sonic, so where is the line?  
perhaps you think shadow still fits the descriptive threshold for "is a sonic."  

[in such a scenario, is this a sonic?](https://www.deviantart.com/nero-blackwing/art/My-OC-is-best-OC-318764668)  
I can barely tell it's based on sonic the hedgehog designs and, without context,  
I wouldn't assume this character has anything to do with Sonic the Hedgehog.

What we are left with is an artistic ship of theseus, a pointed lack of binary,  
a rejection of framework and context, and no clear boundaries.

Introduce Sonic Forces, a game in which you can create your own character that is owned in all iterations by Sega,  
and you start to see how these things you would expect to have concrete boundaries  
seem to have no boundaries at all, and that doesn't FEEL correct.  
[Sonic Forces Example A](https://www.deviantart.com/bmbrice/art/Sonic-Forces-OC-Treble-Keyes-718168631)  
[Sonic Forces Example B](https://www.deviantart.com/bmbrice/art/Sonic-Forces-OC-Noods-718168711)  
[Sonic Forces Example C](https://www.deviantart.com/bmbrice/art/Sonic-Forces-OC-Spurs-718168750)  
[Sonic Forces Example D](https://www.deviantart.com/bmbrice/art/Sonic-Forces-OC-Cage-718168540)  

[How about this picture of Megaman and Sonic?](https://www.deviantart.com/ch40sknight/art/Megaman-and-Sonic-375382859)

If yes, does Sega own Megaman?  
Can you prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the two characters in this image are different characters,  
instead of separate renderings of the same character?  
namely, Sonic The Hedgehog?  
I can't.  
Not without referencing canon, and since this is fan-art, it's already non-canonical.

[City of Heroes actually helps provide context to this,][03]  
since sonic forces doesn't seem to actually have any EULA stipulations about ownership,  
and that's probably a very good thing.  
For definitions sake, IP means Intellectual Property.  
This might get a tad technical, so I'll put a tl;dr at the end in case you need a clarifier  

"Section six, subsection a, You acknowledge, and further agree,  
that You have no IP right related to any Service, Content, Software,  
or any combination of the foregoing or parts thereof"

that bodes well...

"Section six, subsection b, To the extent You may claim any such IP right(s),  
You hereby grant NCsoft a worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, sub-licensable,  
perpetual and irrevocable license and full authorization to exercise all rights of any kind  
or nature associated with such IP right(s), and all ancillary and subsidiary rights thereto,  
in any languages and media now known or not currently known.

TL;DR: if you use our tools, we own your OC, and everything your OC does.  
Forever.  
In like, every concievable way.  
City of Heroes had a character creator that was much more robust than the sonic one,  
but I stumbled onto this as a result of a conversation in research  
Also, nobody makes fanart of city of heroes characters.  
Nobody.  
So I'm just going to stick with sonic.  
Who actually owns the creative works facilitated by tools owned by companies?  
In this, I am including Naoto Ohshima, the person who designed sonic in the first place,  
because he doesn't own sonic, and he never did.  
He used Sega's tools to make Sonic, and as such, Sega owns it.  
They probably own a lot of his work that never got released as well, since we do make duds from time to time.  
And I want to know if these are fundamentally any different.  
Does facilitating creativity naturally lead to the person who facilitated that creativity owning what was created?  
I would say no, I don't think someone else owning creativity tools gives them a right to own someone else's art.  
As such, I think we should own the facilitation of creativity as artists.  
in owning the creative facilities as artists,  
we would have control over what gets made and we get to benefit directly from the work we do.

"but how?" you may ask, and I agree, that seems perposterous, so let's define "art" a bit more
[Work Art List]
[Is this art?](https://www.boredpanda.com/food-art/)  
[How about now? hungry?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carl-warners-foodscapes-photography_us_55a81af3e4b04740a3df7436)  
[Notre-Dame is definitely art from the way people talk about it](ISTOCK.COM/AMPUEROLEONARDO)  

[Is this clock art?][05] (05 - Video)  
it is a machine, produced by a person for the purposes of it being art

Perhaps you don't like how that looks,
[how about this? That's a pretty clock!][06] (06 - Video)  
We can even see How It's Made!  
And in the video, you will see hands.  
People are making these clocks,  
and they don't own them because they don't own the machines they use to make the clocks.  
Someone else gets most of the money when one of those clocks is sold,  
very little of it usually reaches the artisans  .
I think they should own the tools they use to make the clocks,  
as well as the full benefit from selling the clock.

we often hear terms like "means of production" and they sound like gobbledygook nonsense out of context,  
but really, the concept is as simple as owning the tools you use to make stuff, as well as the stuff you make.  
And if you agree with me that you should own the sonic OC you drew based on a character you made in sonic forces,  
I think you should agree that sonic should be owned by his creator,  
and I think you would also agree that Edison did not invent the light bulb.  
Yup, that's what it was about the whole time.  
Fuck Edison!  
Hail Tesla!  

[\*article about Tesla's eugenics*][07] (07)  

oh come ON!  
FINE!  
It's about the artists owning the tools and product of their creativity.  
If you create something, you have made art, regardless of utility or form.  
The artistic ship of theseus is made up of everything.  
Man, I really shouldn't have started replacing my script on copyright infringement with my script on labor rights.  
Hard to discern which video I've made now...
