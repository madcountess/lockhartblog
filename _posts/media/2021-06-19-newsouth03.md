Ahoy hoy, I'm Luna, the People's Bayonet!  
That's peoplesbayo.net!  
Comin' at you as-live from occupied Georgia!  
My friends, my family, my fellow new southerners.  
The more things change, the more they stay the same,  
isn't that how things always go?  

During a recent press conference with Guatamalan president Alejandro Giammattei,  
[Kamala Harris told refugees to "seek hope at home" and "do not come."][01](01)  
[Arizona just refurbished their Aushwitz-esque gas chambers,][02](02)  
[including zyklon B, according to the expense reports][03](03)  
[and Biden threatened a reporter to avoid questions about the apartheid state currently slaughtering Palestinians.][04](04)  
But at least Trump is gonna Get His, right?  
[Nah, not really, Biden is gonna try to defend him against rape allegations.][05](05)  
It is said that all that must happen for evil to thrive is for good men to do nothing.  
I would not call Joe Biden a "good man" but he's... sure doin' nothin' about that "bad man"  
Right?  
Orange Man Bad?  
Whatever.  
The people who told me to vote for Biden so we could "push him left" or whatever,  
how's that going?  
[Well, Joe Biden is planning to illegally cut unemployment benefits,][06](06)  
because it "makes sense."
So, did that opportunity cost pay off?  
Is Biden helping the workers?  
no?  
how predictable.

As I become more and more certain about the path that is necessary to secure a future for humanity,  
the more shit I get from people who buy into reformism, reaction, opportunism, and quite frankly liberalism.  

You're letting yourselves get distracted, my friends, for I am not your enemy.

The undercurrents of opportunism in the 2020 anti-police protests were wide-spread.  
we went from "abolish the police"  
to "defund the police"  
to "cut police funding significantly"  
to "reform the police"  
to "just vote Biden."

[How's that going?][07](07)  
Police killings this year are on par with previous 4 years,  
so I would say not very well.

my friends you may have the will to post online,  
you may have the will to call your representatives,  
you may even have the will to withhold your vote,  
but do you have the will to revolt?
do you have the will to ignore reformist bait and blaze a path to revolution?  
Do ya, punk?  

we can't skip straight to revolution,  
because we'll get smothered and then our corpses will be slandered by the liberal press.  
We have to organize, grow numbers, etc.  
and we can't do that by just accepting reforms and calming down.

[to quote Rosa Luxemburg, Reform or Revolution, Chapter 10 (1900)][T1]

"
Opportunism is incompatible with socialism in general,  
its internal tendency is to push the labour movement into [liberalist] paths,  
[and] tends to paralyze completely the [working] class struggle.
[...]
What appears to characterize [opportunism] above all?  
A certain hostility to “theory.”  
This is quite natural, for our “theory,” that is, the principles of scientific socialism,  
impose clearly marked limitations to practical activity –  
insofar as it concerns the aims of this activity,  
the means used in attaining these aims,  
and the method employed in this activity.  
It is quite natural for people who run after immediate “practical” results to want to free themselves from such limitations and to render their practice independent of our “theory.”
"

We've been dealing with this for over 100 years now.  
We saw what happened with opportunism in Germany in the 1900s,  
the man who shot Rosa in the back of the head,  
and threw her in the Landwehr Canal,  
got a tax break for his troubles once Hitler took power.

The main issue we have in opportunism is the impulse to compromise for crumbs
so people like DeRay McKesson
from ferguson to 8 can't wait
he used to be seen as a major voice of dissent, but effectively,  
his career has been compromise after compromise,  
until he was fully recuperated by the system against which he got famous for speaking out.  
he took every opportunity, even the bad ones.  

"Theory" or more accurately,  
sticking to our principles of action and goal,  
prevents us from picking up crumbs like minor police reform,  
because it's not the point.  
principally, we can't just get better people in charge of the current police system and have things be good.  
our current state is set up to protect Capital, exclusively.  
the reason I speak out against opportunism is because it wastes energy while throwing out all of the socialist dialectics and experiments.  
it's like doing science without precautions.  
shit will go bad without taking history into account.

the things that she's saying are off-limits by the standards of scientific socialism are things that have been proven not to work.  
things like compromising on core principles, and reform.

it's no mistake that the people who push for reforms tend to work for very well funded charity organizations,  
or are media-savvy activists-turned-journalists who made their names calling for reform amidst the flames and bloodshed that have racked this country for YEARS now

if we look at the theoretical basis of these organizations,  
it can be difficult to find a single shred of theory beyond  
"if we throw money at the problem, we can make it go away"  
and "it's okay to shirk our responsibilities for short-term, short-lived concessions"

I'm sorry, my friends, but this just isn't how capitalism works.

They won't EVER concede.

feel free to push for reforms in your spare time,  
I'm not gonna stop you,  
but know that if you are working for a reformist organization rather than a revolutionary organization,  
it's not doing revolutionary work, it's doing the work of reform, which kills organization and action.

why does it kill organization and action?  
that seems like I should justify it,  
well, let me ask, which is technically easier to accomplish?  
reform or revolution?

I would love it if they tried to satiate us,  
but there will be a point at which they can no longer,  
and it's soon.

[In her speech "On the Spartacus Programme" (December 1918) Rosa Luxemburg said:][T2]

"
History is not going to make our revolution an easy matter like the [liberalist] revolutions.  
In those revolutions it sufficed to overthrow that official power at the centre and to replace a dozen or so of persons in authority.  
But we have to work from beneath.  
Therein is displayed the mass character of our revolution,  
one which aims at transforming the whole structure of society.  
It is thus characteristic of the modern [worker's] revolution,  
that we must effect the conquest of political power, not from above, but from beneath.

What is now incumbent upon us is that we should deliberately concentrate all the forces of the working class for an attack upon the very foundations of capitalist society.
There, at the root, where the individual employer confronts his wage slaves;
at the root where all the executive organs of ownership rule confront the object of this rule,
confront the masses;
there, step by step,
we must seize the means of power from the rulers,  
we must take them into our own hands.
"

the people in power and close to power have no interest in giving it up.  
we will not find help from above.  
we have to rely on each-other, and not on the systems in place,  
because the goal is to upheave, remove, and replace the entire system,  
to renew society, and free us all.

I can hardly blame y'all for being charmed by reformism and opportunism,  
it's a charming beast for sure!  
Revolution, but easier?  
That's an attractive prospect.

The other element of opportunism is reaction,  
generally a bastardization of Direct Action,  
where someone will burn down a chain store,  
and call it revolutionary action to invigorate the masses.  
It rarely, if ever, actually works out this way.

[In the words of Trotsky, who is a mixed bag, on Individual Terrorism:][T3]  
"
In our eyes, individual terror is inadmissible,
precisely because it belittles the role of the masses in their own consciousness,
reconciles them to their powerlessness,
and turns their eyes and hopes towards a great avenger, and liberator,
who some day will come and accomplish [their] mission.
The [opportunist] prophets of the ‘propaganda of the deed’ can argue all they want  
about the elevating and stimulating influence of terrorist acts on the masses.
Theoretical considerations and political experience prove otherwise.
The more ‘effective’ the terrorist acts, the greater their impact,
the more they reduce the interest of the masses, in self-organisation and self-education.
But the smoke from the confusion clears away, the panic disappears,
the successor of the murdered minister makes his appearance,
life again settles into the old rut,
the wheel of capitalist exploitation turns as before;
only the police repression grows more savage and brazen.
And as a result, in place of the kindled hopes,  
and artificially aroused excitement,
comes disillusionment and apathy.
"

does this sound familiar?
organized protests being forced into rioting is one thing,  
but it is justified on the backs of individual terrorism like tearing down a statue or burnin down a wendy's.  
This is not a condemnation of direct action,  
it's a condemnation of reaction and retribution.  
I can't criticize the people who burn shit down too much,  
sometimes fire is just how we cleanse sin,  
but the practical effect of opportunist terrorism,  
is shown to be a lessening of support for whatever movement is blamed for the attack.  
my second video, which is no longer online,  
criticized protesters tearing down statues on camera and sharing it on social media.
it compared those actions to the destruction of coffee machines thanks to a fox news presenter,  
and I think that wasn't quite fair

should we get rid of these statues?  
yes.
we should get rid of ALL of them.
but we cannot let the catharsis at seeing an empty symbol of oppression fall sate our need for revolution.
there are no two ways about it, opportunism in its reformist or retributive approaches does not work.
on one end of the opportunist current, we have liberal progressives like DeRay McKesson,
the 8CantWait guy, who offers crumbs and suppresses fervor.
On the other end, we have individual terrorist actions,  
like how Rayshard Brooks' girlfriend allegedly burned down the Wendy's at which Rayshard was killed,  
possibly as retribution for the manager calling the cops on Rayshard.  
[She was convicted and put on house arrest,][08] (08)  
the manager got a new job, Wendy's kept plugging,  
and the Atlanta police cracked down harder on protesters the very. next. day.

this may sound like a complaint about optics,  
but optics and marketing are legitimately the same thing.
if we want an organized working class movement,  
we have to recruit workers into our organizations,  
and that is going to require a bit of marketing and optics management.  
this is honestly not to say "be nice to liberalists" or anything like that.  
it's to say that we need to be better than the US Army at recruiting,  
because that's the model currently dominating organizational recruitment.  
what we need to have is a strong organization,  
or a federation of organizations,  
with the explicit goal of revolution.  

In the past, this has been done with Political Parties,  
but I think the American Political System is currently set up to destroy vanguardist parties,  
from the inside out or just by having cops break through the front door and arrest 'em all with spurious allegations.

Don't let me stop you from tryin',  
I'm sure there's some vanguardist party out there,  
but I haven't heard of 'em to be quite honest.

What we need is a new kind of organization,  
a federation of organizations with the same charter but no directly dismantlable center, for now.

I will be working on making an outline of the process I propose,  
the methods I propose,  
and why we need to embrace the danger instead of cowering in its presence.

Go to People's Bayonet, that's PeoplesBayo.Net,  
for sources and transcript,  
as well as ways to fund this operation.  
To a working unity, my friends.  
Solidarity forever. ✊
