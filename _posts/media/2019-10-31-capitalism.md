##	Arguments For Capitalism (Are Mostly Bull****) (Problem 08)  
blah blah it's a travesty the things we have to do to get by in this world  
blah blah class consciousness blah blah eat the rich.  
[Video (High Data/Stream) {Youtube}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eBMPzKvyos)

The markets are all broken,  
that's why the world's a mess.  
But which system beckons  
from far beyond the veil  
bringing us together  
around a pint of ale  
are the markets working?  
if so, why am I stressed?  
is success a measure?  
a measure of success?  

## The Mythical Success of Capitalism  
What do we define as success, my friends?  
What has succeeded and what has failed, my confidants?  
Have we had a system that succeeded yet, in history, my loves?  
And has the system around us failed us, now, my comrades?  
Let us look at the failures of other nations  
and contrast them with our own  
my People.  

## Health  
[there's frankly an upsetting amount of data on our healthcare spending,][01] (01)
[and let's see the results][02] (02)

Aww it's terrible.  
Dang.  
I was hoping for "Fine, Just Fine" but okay.  
But data without context are inconsequential, we need Context.  

[In the latest data I can find from the World Health Organization,][03] (03)    
the socialist country known as The Republic of Cuba,  
spends a whopping 2500 bucks a year on each person.  
that's 11-12% of GDP on public health spending, which is WAY higher than the US' 8%  
the US has another 8% on private spending, so at least 16%  
though, I can't seem to find any numbers on private healthcare spending in Cuba  
I wonder why that might be  
oh well.

Also, you don't necessarily get better care when you spend more money  
for example on this principle, store-brand cereal is just as good as name-brand  
pregabalin is just as good as Lyrica  
and it turns out, just charging more without improving service is entirely possible, and therefore, prevalent.  

[There are diminishing returns on cost-per-patient versus quality of care,][04] (04)  
as it is suggested by the evidence that  
"treatment intensity, and not differences in quality reflected in prices" has the greatest impact on quality of care.  
Treatment intensity is basically a measure of how frequently a patient is seen by a doctor,  
and if preventative care is aggressively pursued.  
If your doctor sees you,  
checks your blood pressure,  
and sends you out the door with some prescription,  
to return in 3 or 6 months,  
your needs are regularly not met and frequently get worse before you can see the doctor  
This is why mortality rates in rich people hospitals are only marginally lower than the general public's  

The only real effect this has on the quality of care is  
that any health care is essentially unaffordable without insurance,  
something treated as a commodity.  
At least in how it's priced,  
and until the ACA,  
how it was deniable to the people who seriously needed it,  
because they have something like...  
I dunno...  
A heritable disease?  
like asthma?  
or Crones?  
Or like, literally any mental condition other than 100% clear?  
And we multiply the problem when we consider that children are also subject to this free market system,  
so if their parents can't afford insurance,  
they don't get healthcare because they can't afford it either.  
Y'know. For kids.  
CHIP is a good option for the kids and the teens,  
but that's in danger of being dismantled by Republicans and Democrats in congress.  

Speaking of commodity,  
mental healthcare is treated as shameful,  
and as such is less profitable to set up a practice for.  
This leads to inadequate care,  
and the lack of regulation has in-turn inspired a lot of quackery,  
in a vicious cycle that has driven pill mills and mistrust,  
leading to less people getting adequate care, etc etc.  
this trends towards demonizing people with POSSIBLE mental health issues,  
further stigmatizing mental health as a whole.


[Keith Olbermann, stigmatizing mental health as a whole to "dunk" on "trump"][05] (05-Video)  
[as if he himself isn't a eugenicist piece of shit:][06] (06)  
"Trump is indeed effing crazy  
his brain does not work correctly  
there is a myriad of possible explanation  
and we have hit them all here  
congenital disease, drug use  
any of a dozen post-concussion traumas  
alzheimers, senility, lack of common sense  
lack of awareness of things in the world besides himself  
and endless specific emotional or psychological or intellectual incapacities  
or all of these things at the same time"

god you're a dick.

Dental care is also treated as a commodity, and I know that personally.  
I have medicare because I'm disabled as fuck,  
and I'm having to look into cheap dental care because medicare doesn't provide dental insurance.  
Yeah.  
It's bad.  
A lot of this is the result of a shame-driven culture around medical issues,  
for which I can't, for the life of me, discern the purpose.  
But as a result of this insurance-based system,  
drugs and procedures are significantly more expensive here  
than they are just to the north of us and all around the world
people like, again, Martin Shkreli,  
take the opportunity to absolutely explode the price of something to get the most money out of insurance companies  
while leaving the people who tend to use that medication  
(hint hint, it's marginalized people with not much money)  
unable to pay for life-saving medication.  

This is the same issue with the Epi-Pen and Insulin,  
which are both proprietary drugs and do not have generics available  
as a result of our patent system and our medical certification system  
And if, God forbid, you have a disability,  
and you're having trouble getting on disability or a job with benefits,  
your medical bills will pile up until your debt kills you.  

To go back to Cuba,  
a socialist country,  
we can see that the healthcare provided to the people is not provided by any greedy corporations,  
but by the government.
This healthcare tends to be of a higher quality,  
as preventative care and intensity of care are prioritized  
over profit incentives and expensive and/or invasive procedures.  
If you feel sick, see a doctor.  
if you break something, see a doctor.  
if you are in pain, see a doctor.  
and none if it is mediated by a private sector trying to make a buck rather than heal the sick.  

I think it would be good if we here in the US started to work towards implementing this kind of system.  
At the very least, initiatives like Medicare for All are good steps,  
but will only really be universal healthcare if we get rid of private industry...  
[USSR and PRC flags start closing in, gesture to stop]  

O-okay. Let's step back and move on.  
We wouldn't want the accusation of being a Communist here, right?  

## Freedom  
Alongside Freedom, one of the prides of our land is our security in our homes.  
we have a right to privacy.  
and we're not gonna get stopped unless we've done something wrong.  
well...

In 2013, now former NSA director Michael Hayden got up in front of the White House Press Pool  
[and denied that "probable cause" was a part of the 4th amendment][07] (07-Video)


Reporter: The measure is 'Probable Cause' I believe  
Hayden: The amendment says 'unreasonable search and seizure'  
Reporter: But does it not say 'prob-  
Hayden: No!
\**Press Pool Clip Ends  
Keith Olbermann: Well, maybe they have a different constitution over there at the NSA.

YOU AGAIN? W...whatever.  
Our government doesn't like due process any more than the vigilantes  
charged with the crime of not following due process do.  
and this is the kind of thing the Soviets were allegedly doing,  
but we never turned a mirror to ourselves and the countless violations of privacy we commit here.  
THE PATRIOT act was rushed into law after 9/11 and has created some of the worst of these violations  

when it was signed into law,  
the simultaneous establishment of Homeland Security ensured its perpetuation,  
and as a result,  
we have some agencies for which we must thank the Republican and Democratic lawmakers who created it  
First and foremost, the TSA  
We hate the TSA in this country,  
we think it's a waste of time,  
we think it's absurd the things we have to throw away just to go a few states over.  
what's wrong with this bottle of water I just bought RIGHT over there, huh?  
WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH A BOTTLE OF WATER, HUH!?  
FUCKIN' DROWN THE PILOT!?!?  

[In a talk by security expert Bruce Schneier,][08] (08-Video)  
who coined the term "security theatre" talks about the kinda terrible heuristics we use to assess risk and security.  
as he says, "we keep sacrificing virgins and our unicorn defenses have held true"  
we don't have enough examples of failures because the risk is so rare  
we had a shoe bomber once  
ONCE  
and we suddenly had to remove our shoes every time we wanted to go anywhere by air.  
how many shoe bombers have been stopped at the gates by this measure?  
well, I don't know.  
how many shoe bombers have gotten through?  
well, our unicorn defenses have held true so far, might as well throw another virgin on the fire  
the only references I can find to it are the first incident, and then

[a Qatari diplomat being accused of making a shoe bomb joke on a plane:][09]  (09-Video)  
"Muhammad al Madadi is described as third secretary to the Qatari embassy in washington.   
Officials say al Madadi at some point left his first class seat,  
and went to the plane's bathroom to apparently smoke a cigarette.
When he emerged, two air marshals, also in first class,  
stopped him and sat with him for the remainder of the flight.  
Officials say it was while he was seated that he then reportedly made a joke  
or a wise-crack about trying to light his shoes on fire.  
An apparent reference to the 2001 so-called "Shoe Bomber" Richard Reed,  
and that set off alarm bells with the air marshals."

What were you THINKING dude?  
The next agency for which we have to thank the PATRIOT act is ICE  
ICE has been around for roughly about 18 years now,  
it can smoke, good work guys,  
and it's currently being treated as a long-standing tradition of our police state undeserving of scrutiny.  

We are also under a surveillance state, though not necessarily in the same capacity.  
Here on the internet,  
your metrics,  
your data,  
your search history,  
purchase history,  
and browsing history,  
are all collected on a mass scale by various companies like Facebook  
Most big telecoms companies have come under fire for signing agreements  
with law enforcement to sell their users data.  
Regardless of if it's for loyalty checks or loyalty rewards,  
our loyalties are being recorded all the time.

That sounds familiar, doesn't it?  
like the gestapo.  
sure that's a coincidence tho.  

## Food  
But let's say that's unimportant.  
so what, the police state's gonna police state and capitalism's gotta capitalism right?  
Well, I think we should talk about food  
Many communities in the USA have what many would call  
"a lack of sufficient nutrition for sustaining a healthy life"  
and what I would call "borderline famine"

In most of these communities, there are few if any fresh food options  
Most food in these communities is consumed from a box or a can,  
pre-processed and stuffed full of corn syrup to make up for calories lost in processing  
Point to starvation in one socialist country,  
and I'll point you to a city in america with similar starvation.  
and if not, I'll point to hundreds of capitalist communities across the globe  
that don't even have the utopian levels of starvation we have in the united states.

The main issue is people not being able to afford food, however.  
There are food banks and soup kitchens in many parts of the country,  
but the dreaded "bread lines" of supposedly Soviet origin are still rampant here in the united states.  
I'm in georgia, there are like, a thousand churches per square meter here?  
so I somewhat frequently go out and notice a "free bread!" sign out front and a line pouring out the door.  
We may pretend like starvation is a "third world" problem, but it's rampant here, and it's entirely preventable.  
the problem isn't supply, but distribution, provision,  
which is something we can do something about today.  
check out "food not bombs" for more information on that, by the way.  

## Jobs  
I discussed this in my first video, but it's certainly worth circling back to.  
There's a serious problem we have here in the US, and its name is "wage labor"  
Currently, the only way to eat is to have money, and the only way to have money is to work,  
and the only way to find work is... big question mark.  
"The Gig Economy" is a term you'll likely have heard going around to describe having no career opportunities.  
Basically, you're at the whim of the free labor market,  
which is a bit more telling by its name than most of its proponents would likely admit.  
[Hiring practices are highly race and gender dependent.][10] (10)


[transcript]:  
"using women's names for thousands of administrative assistant and retail sales jobs,  
men's names for custodian and security guard  
he also varied the age.  
the results were dramatically different by age, but just among the women."  

[Wages are highly race and gender dependent][11] (11)  

[Benefits are highly race and gender dependent as well as being highly dependent on whether or not you have a disability of any sort][12] (12)

and if you don't fit "able-bodied white man" then oh well, you just get to eat less I guess.  
oh right, and in many states, if you don't fit society's norms in any other way,  
you're at the whim of how progressive your employer is, and even then,  
they could decide they're done with your queer ass and toss you out for that with little legal repercussion if any.  
do we have stats on minority rights in socialist states?  
yes?  
it's also not perfect?  
well, nobody's perfect, right?
whatever.  
Also, if you're gay or trans or {motions at body} sufficiently intersex,  
you can be evicted or denied lodging/housing, and you'll have to live on the streets.  
soooo, how about the rights of homeless people then?  
well...

## Housing  
All across capitalist countries, [the scourge of "unpleasant design,"][13] (13)  
as discussed in the book of the same name by Selena and Gordon Salvic, runs rampant  
we have architecturally designed homelessness further into the margins of cities  
with spikes and leaning benches and geometric nightmares,  
[and even the occasional robocop trashcan.][14] (14)    

how about just buy a home?  
or rent it, that seems like a reasonable thing to do.  
well, the problem is known as Gentrification.  
I've had it argued to me that Gentrification doesn't happen by some neoliberal grifter,  
so I think I'm going to need to define it.  
Gentrification: The restoration and upgrading of deteriorated urban property by middle-class or affluent people,  
often resulting in displacement of lower-income people.  
Got it?  
There's a single study that is cited to denegrate the idea of gentrification existing.  
it has been shown to be accurate for the time it covered, in large part.  
the problem is that the study stopped data collection in 1999,  
and it's been 20 years since then, so we can't just apply it to today.  
Doing so would be incredibly disingenuous.  
Also, even back then, there was a seriously large homeless population.  
Right now, services like AirBnB are turbo-charging gentrification's worst effects  
by allowing landlords to evict their tenants in favor of higher-profit "hotel" services.  
This is thankfully becoming SLIGHTLY more regulated, but it's not getting better any time soon.

Let's also talk about how weird it is that we have a housing market with significant surplus  
that has been gathering dust for years, far in excess of the number of homeless people.  
The supply outstrips the demand by miles, yet the prices continue to grow.  


[George Carlin on building affordable housing on golf courses][15] (15)  
Gotta love carlin, man.  
and really, would THAT be so terrible?  
a few fewer golf courses and nobody's homeless?  
I think that'd be just peachy, yeah?  

Or we could just take those empty houses away from the people who are keeping them empty  
and give them to homeless people and families.  
or rebuild in the location, put up public housing.  
a bunch of apartments or something.  
it would be better than nothing, that's for certain.  
and much cheaper and easier to maintain than running a bunch of cops around shooing people off benches  
and installing fucking spikes to keep people from sleeping in the only places that are available.  
the USSR, which had a mandate of non-eviction...  
and made homelessness a crime,  
which seems a bit weird,  
but they effectively eliminated homelessness up until it was illegally dissolved and Russia had adopted capitalism,  
at which point, homelessness rates skyrocketed.  
honestly, just having public housing would be fantastic, to be honest.  

[right now, funding for public housing is being stripped by Republicans and Democrats,][16] (16)  
leaving more homeless people on the street, unable to pay for rent or god forbid buy a house.  
landlords are really the problem here, they own so much land,  
and they charge a fortune for people to live in what would otherwise be empty.  
perhaps we should start looking into reducing landlording and eliminating landlords...

[USSR and PRC flags close in, gesture to stop]  
O-okay. Let's... step back... and move on.  
"Communism" is not the...  
\**sigh  
it's not the only way this shakes out, right?  
we're just talking about solutions to problems we have right now in the real world,  
and some socialist countries beat The Big Capitalism: USA.  
And that's all we're talking about.

[Bayonet character is replaced by Chaos character briefly, with a look disappointed anger on her marked face]

## Democracy  
I've heard just... too many times to count that Socialism and Democracy,  
as a base concept, are incompatible.  
Let's see how capitalism is doing in that regard!  


[in 2017, we started a streak of years in which we are no longer considered a full democracy,][17] (17)  
but a "flawed democracy."
So, we're not in a brutal authoritarian regime, but we're uhhh gettin' there.  
But how, you may ask, did it suddenly become a non-democracy in 2017?  
Well, it's not just Trump, this has been going on a while,  
a rightward so called drift in the "Overton Window."  
Democrats have been playing patty cakes with the Republicans for decades upon decades  
to the point that they're virtually identical.  
And for the most part, going by military standards at least, they have been.  
Now, about that rightward shift...

First thing I'd like to look at here is our Gerrymandering problem.  
Many people have covered this much better than I could,  
but we have districts in this country that are drawn around party lines, and not around pure demographics  
This essentially makes red and blue districts from generally purple areas,  
and frequently red districts out of blue districts,  
[because that's a thing and isn't illegal.][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering]  
Perhaps we should make carving up america into easier to digest chunks,  
specifically with the goal of having an electorate that is in no way represented in the halls of power,  
a fuckin' crime?  
public opinion and laws have drifted apart since time immemorial.  

[In a study by Princeton it was shown that public opinion has no effect on policy,][18] (18)  
but only in the general public.  
The curve actually holds true for rich people.  
so I guess, if you want your voices heard, just... become rich!  
because money is speech!  
capitalism!  
investment!  
returns!

## Censorship  
Another thing we hear about in relation to Socialist countries  
is that they censor anything that is out of the party line.  
which sure, did happen, but I have some real bad news if you live in good ol' capitalist USA.

For the most part, unless you're giving to independently funded media  
{finger guns} thanks by the way for that,  
you are probably watching and reading mainstream news, owned by companies.

I have more on that in the 2 other posts/videos I did about Mainstream and/or Liberal media,  
so I'm keepin' this bit short  
You should go check 'em out  
[MSM1][https://peoplesbayo.net/2019/03/06/msm.html]    
[MSM2][https://peoplesbayo.net/2019/07/14/msm2.html]  

it's interesting watching my production value shoot through the roof  
even though my budget has stayed roughly the same.  
{finger guns} seriously, thanks for that.  
What does our dear and glorious leader think of most accredited journalists?  
Fake news!  
What does he think of fake news?  
["The Enemy of The People"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz21AIC0M4s)  
Well, that's really nice to hear.  
Saying that reporters are not telling the truth,  
all reporters except for the State Media, Fox News,  
are lying and creating danger,
[is in and of itself dangerous.][19] (19-Video)


that phone call still gives me the jibblies.  
It's an attack on our freedom of press,  
it's an attack on our freedom of speech,  
it's an attack on the freedoms laid out in our constitution, but...  
More in the abstract, what is a freedom and what is a liberty?  
It might be one person's freedom to swing a sword wildly around with no care for anyone's safety,  
but it would impede many peoples' liberty to not fear for their lives and or get limbs lopped off.  
Perhaps, when we talk about things like "Religious Freedom"  
we have to keep in mind the liberty of those who are not fundamentalists.  
Because right now, you are free to be as fundamentalist christian as you like,  
but many people don't have the liberty of having their needs met,  
whether that be birth control, abortion, or like,  
[if you have a baby but you're gay?][20] (20)    

I mean, this is mostly just a continuation of a trend of business owners  
using their prejudice to bully minority groups out of the public eye  
Do remember how run down the black water fountains are in pictures about the Jim Crow era,  
and please, I dare you, tell me you'd drink from one.  
The fears are the same, the target has changed, and we're still here pretending like refusing service,  
as a "right" as a "freedom" to choose your customers,  
instead of an impedance on the liberty of those of the land of liberty.  
How about we start treating the liberties of the people around us as more important  
than the freedom to condemn those people to poverty, starvation, illness, and death?  
That sounds like a pretty reasonable shift, to me.  
But who knows, maybe I'm unreasonable?  

[USSR and PRC flags close in]  
O-okay.  
Can I have even one criticism of the status quo without being labeled a communist?  

[On-Screen Glitches, Chaos Growls]

**Bayonet groans, grabs her forehead  
sorry, y'all.  
migrane or something  

In conclusion, we have a few options going forward:  
We can democratize the workplace, perhaps through union membership originally,  
but the goal would be to remove the boss and just have the workers run and own the business instead of just run.  
We can start up and support chapters of "Food Not Bombs" as a form of direct action to help starving people.  
We can start looking into publicizing housing, or at least revitalizing the public housing system.  
we MUST provide universal immutable healthcare with a high focus on preventative care.  
work on solutions to our climate impact.  
maybe we should do something about capitalism.

[USSR and PRC flags start closing in]  
NO.
I SAID.  
N-  

[Chaos]  
NO!  
move, worm!  
push that dirt, dig that hole, get eaten by  
early bird investors and boards of directors   
find solace in your toil  
in the ground eating soil, so  
move it, worm!  
push that mud,  
dig that hole,  
or rise to the occasion,  
and do something about the bird problem we seem to have.  
The way forward mustn't be through military action.  
the way forward mustn't be through state-ownership of the economy.  
the way forward mustn't be through reactive violence.  
the way forward must include us all.  
the way forward is [sneering finger quotes] "utopian."  

[Bayonet]  
Actually, Utopia is a political satire by Thomas More,  
and it depicts a society as being mostly a religiously progressive land of comfort  
It's hotly debated among scholars whether or not More was satirizing the catholic church or their detractors,  
as the text doesn't make it clear  
So, really, when people say "utopian" they just mean that something seems unrealistic.  
This is unrealistic!  
Nobody's going to agree with that, you know.  
I think it's fine to call something utopian if nobody's going to agree with it, right?  

[Chaos]  
NO.  
It's an insidious term, a brain worm telling you a lie.  
a lie that THIS [hail of capitalist-overseen disasters] is the BEST we can get!  
But, there is no shining beacon on the hill, it's a fantasy.  
dangling the promise of paradise on earth over a never ending pit of despair.  
"upward mobility" is a myth.  
you will always be as poor as you are unless we do something about the rich.  
the rich own the means of production.  
the rich own the representatives of the people's will.  
the rich own the avenues of government through lobbying.  

[Bayonet]  
Actually, all we need to do is repeal the Citizens United decision,  
just get money out of politics!  
You see, we just have to make sure we're electing the right people who represent our values  
This is all a bit silly, just vote democrat!  

[Chaos]  
NO!  
These politicians can't do anything for us,  
they aren't our saviors  
they ignore science in favor of feelings  
oh it feels cold?  
it FEELS COLD!?  
oh well throw out the consensus,  
I guess global fucking warming isn't happening.  
when the fire fighters  
debate over whether  
gunpowder or gasoline  
will put out the fire  
it doesn't matter if  
it's your fault or mine  
it's our responsibility  
to put out the fire  
and fire the fighters  

[Bayonet]  
I mean, I think I can probably get on board with that,  
but what are we going to tell the fine people at home?  
They're probably wondering why I'm just standing here arguing with the air in front of me.  
I guess, just... don't buy this argument that "socialism has never succeeded" for one moment.  
Now, am I saying that any one Socialism is perfect?  
Am I saying that all Capitalisms have failed?  
No, it's just a measure.  
A measure, of success.  
Don't let the pundits fool you  
with their claims of ten-D chess  
The oceans are rising, the mighty are falling  
and tomorrow's disasters are written in the sands of yesterday's mistakes  
The system in which we live  
has crumbled all around us  
the pints of ale have soured  
the markets start to close  
but we still have each other  
and that could be enough  
to bring us to a future  
a future made with love  
collectivize and activate  
change the way we operate  
join a union, for it is what makes us strong,  
help us bring our world back from famine and from war  
say, comrades, join us,  
in working unity,  
in solidarity,  
forever evermore.
