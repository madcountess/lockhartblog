## The Equality "Debate"

So, the entire concept of "Equality of Outcome" is built upon the work of one dude.  
Milton Friedman, who I will be addressing at the end of this video, so stay tuned.  
To start, Friedman notes a particular set of definitions for the different types of equality.  
Equality before God, equality of opportunity, and equality of outcome.  
I haven't seen any arguments in favor of equality of outcome anywhere.  
[We have this guy on fox news talking about it][01] (01)  

we have strange articles on fox news about it... actually let's dive way down deep into the article I found.  
it kinda lays out the core of this argument and cites some very interesting sources.  
To quote Wendy McElroy, owner of ifeminist dot com,  
in her article ["Equal Access Does Not Guarantee Equal Outcome"][02] (02)  
which is titled reasonably enough...

"If a majority of women do not choose a political career,  
if most women voters do not cast ballots for their own sex,  
this is a fascinating social pattern.  
But it doesn't necessarily say anything about women's equality:  
it only reveals women's preferences.  
Nevertheless,  
politically correct feminists will proclaim that the election returns reflect the oppression of women.  
The definition of equality has changed once more to mean "equality of outcome,"  
not of opportunity or access."  
Election results will probably be included,  
if only indirectly.  
For example, in Kosovo, the U.N. mandated a gender quota."

She then links to ifeminist dot com, a website owned by her, and it's a blog post by her,  
and it's summed up by saying:	 
person wrongly equates election rigging by stacking nominations with political clones  
with making sure that a representative government represents the population it's supposed to represent...  
It's completely ridiculous and doesn't support this point, but let's check out her ideological source  

"Dr. Mark Cooray has well expressed the difference between various concepts of equality within feminism.    
"Equality of opportunity provides in a sense that all start the race of life at the same time.  
Equality of outcome attempts to ensure that everyone finishes at the same time."  
Cooray considers "equality of opportunity and freedom" to be "two facets of the same basic concept."  
Equality of results, however, "is the goal of radical socialism."

Oh dear, radical socialism?  
that sounds super scary.  

[let's check in on that link there][03]  
"Equality of opportunity in the sense of identical opportunity for all individuals is impossible.  
Equality of opportunity provides in a sense that all start the race of life at the same time.   
Equality of outcome attempts to ensure that everyone finishes at the same time.   
To slightly change what the Dodo said in Alice in Wonderland, "Everybody must win and all must have prizes".  
That is the goal of radical socialism.  
Everyone must be a winner, everyone must be equal.  
Socialists do not really point towards absolute equality but they point to vague ideas of fairness and justness."  

Let's see if Milton Friedman shows up in the rest of this site  
Let's check the bibliography for this "book"  
and search  
and Friedman shows up 3 times  
And I don't need to read any further, I've struck gold.

##  Through the Looking Glass  
Alright, so let's just pretend this all didn't happen.  
Let's just go back to the home page of this wonderful little web 2.0 site  
that was apparently last updated january of twenty...ninteen?  
That's kinda surprising  
(Edit: Now that I have a website that looks even lower tech than the one I'm referencing in the video, I feel attacked.)  

Let's see their diagnosis for the decline of civilisation

[How Would I Know If My Civilization Is Declining][04]  
"Decline may be diagnosed by applying any of the following methods:  
1.Determine if the general use of language is losing discipline,  
for this can only mean the general use of thought is also losing discipline, which is the decay of understanding.  
2.Determine if the community is discarding or corrupting traditional beliefs about right and wrong,  
for these beliefs supply sanity so their destruction must win the collapse of order and the loss of communal identity."

Communal identity?  
Perhaps he's talking about collective reality?  
oh.  
no.

"For the moment the majority become selfish,  
traditions are discarded along with concern for their racial character.  
That is, the community loses both its sanity and its racial identity: its nationality.  
The citizens of Western Civilisation no longer pride themselves on being white Christians,  
and their once separate nations have become merely a mass of insane humanity  
with no religion or distinct racial character: a universal state."

That got fashy in a hurry.  
Moving on.

"3.Consider the attitude of children towards their parents."

I've seen this talking point a lot.  
the idea that children must be subserviant to their parents and that parents should be cold and uncaring.  
it's really bizarre, so I'm not surprised that it's here.  

"4.Determine if the community is losing its racial identity (Nationality),  
for this means it is being invaded by other communities."

There's a link to that page on nationalism again

"5.Determine if the community has become Matrist in nature by invoking the rules outlined in 'Sex In History' by G.R. Taylor."

Let's look at the chart included...  
Permissive versus Restrictive views on sexuality, that makes sense as a dichotomy  
we've got Sex Differences Maximized (dress) and minimized respectively  
which I assume means that women dressed more modestly back in the day?  
it's hard to really tell.  
Also, politically authoritarian versus politically democratic... showin' your hand again  
limitation of freedom for women and freedom for women...  
Wow.  
Deep Fear of Homosexuality?  
Yeah, that's pretty normal for cons- what.  
it's contrasted against Fear of Incest.  
wow.  
moving on.

"6.Use one of Arnold Toynbee’s methods outlined in 'A Study of History', which claimed that:  
1, The first eruption of a class war marked the onset of decline.  
and 2, A Declining civilisation will be attacked by Barbarian War Bands;  
a graphic example of such an attack on Western Civilisation being [9/11]"

And we've got an Orwell quote, fancy that...  
"...decay in the general use of language becomes the indisputable hallmark of a declining civilisation.  
As George Orwell put it:  
'A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure,  
and then fail all the more completely because he drinks.  
It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language.  
It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish,  
but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.'  
[—Politics And The English Language (1946)][12] (12)"

You quoted Orwell.  
To decry socialism.  
You have got to be kidding me.  
Orwell was an anarchist and a socialist, dillweed.  
That particular essay is... let's leave it at "somewhat problematic"  
but the ideas within certainly hold water.  
Let's see what is actually being said here... mmm... yes... ah.  
It's saying that people in power frequently use foreign tongues,  
ancient terminology, and excessive verbosity as euphemistic language to get across horrific ideas.

Now, who would be caught dead doing THAT? (picture of Self-Help Author Jordan Peterson)  
Anyway.  
Let's go back to talking about this equality of outcome.  
I have seen hella much many people talking about Jordan Peterson's talking points, but he's really long-winded.  
I'm just looking specifically at where this weird talking point came from,  
and he seems to be the expert on it, so I kinda have to talk about him.  
We good?  
Otherwise you'll have to go your own way.

## The Man in The Mirror
[Jordan Peterson on how The Left is Just As Bad:][06] (06-Video)  
"{the people calling for equality} are seen as nice, are you going to punch them? that's what you're supposed to do to nazis!"

**annoyed silence, points at [MSM Part 2: Blood, Soil, and Milkshakes (The Problem 07)](https://peoplesbayo.net/2019/07/14/msm2.html)

[Jordan Peterson on Joe Rogan's Podcast][07a] (07a-Video)  
Joe Rogan: "What's the connection?"    
Jordan Peterson: "how much tyrrany to impose in order to produce something like equality of outcome.  
Thomas Sowell's talked about this too,  
he said that the people who are agitating for equality of outcome don't understand  
is that you have to cede so much power to the authorities, to the govt,  
in order to ensure equality of outcome that a tyranny is inevitable."

Thomas Sowell, you say?  
[Let's see what he has to say.][07b]	(07b)
"As a teenager, I tried briefly to play basketball.  
But I was lucky to hit the backboard, much less the basket.  
Yet I had just as much opportunity to play basketball as Michael Jordan had.  
But equal opportunity was not nearly enough to create equal outcomes."  

oh wait I get it now, it's a straw-man argument!
People take this guy seriously?  

[[Unfortunately, I cannot reproduce this part of the video in text. Should I be ashamed of myself?]](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/549/301/119.jpg) (20)

hmm, wait.  
a lot of that sounded really familiar.

##  The Reflection  
[(JP conflates tribe and race to avoid directly advocating nationalism)][10]  (10-Video)

["2. Determine if the community is discarding or corrupting traditional beliefs about right and wrong,][05] (05)  
for these beliefs supply sanity so their destruction must win the collapse of order and the loss of communal identity.  
\4. Determine if the community is losing its racial identity (Nationality), for this means it is being invaded by other communities."

[Jordan Peterson on bad things happening "a result of women being in the political space"][08] (08-Video)

["5. Determine if the community has become Matrist in nature by invoking the rules outlined in 'Sex In History' by G.R. Taylor.][05] (05)  
Rule 2 -Limitation of freedom for women	-Freedom for women  
Rule 3 -Women seen as inferior, sinful -Women accorded high status"

[Jordan Peterson on Treating Children "Properly":][11] (11-Video)  
"don't do anything for your children that they can do themselves"

[3. Consider the attitude of children towards their parents.][05] (05)  
When a civilisation is waxing, progeny revere their parents, whom they dare not disobey;  
but when a civilisation is waning, it is the parents who revere their children whom they fear to upset  
(see the law of reverse civilisation.)  
(05) Decline is inevitable because the reversal of authority has an immediate and crucial impact  
on the process by which a community constantly renews itself: the way it rears its children.  
Then, instead of parental authority demanding obedience and respect, it is ruled by children's wants.  

[Jordan Peterson on 9/11:][13] (13)  
"Towers Fell, Bad Answer,  
Knocking Down Invisible Things Related To The Towers,  
The The Afghanistan Happened,  
Soviet Union Fell Because Afghanistan (?)  
and the people who put down the bombs (??)  
were trying to do the same thing HERE (???)"

[05] 6. Use one of Arnold Toynbee’s methods outlined in 'A Study of History',  
which claimed that A Declining civilisation will be attacked by Barbarian War Bands;  
a graphic example of such an attack on Western Civilisation being [9/11]

Okay we've had fun, but that's all coincidental.  
Wait there was one other point  
What was it?

[1. Determine if the general use of language is losing discipline,][05] (05)  
for this can only mean the general use of thought is also losing discipline,  
which is the decay of understanding.

Oh right, and then there was an orwell quote...  
Let's see what Orwell might say of someone like Peterson.  

[There are commonalities among examples of disingenuous language.][12] (12)  
"The first is staleness of imagery;  
the other is lack of precision.  
The writer either has a meaning and cannot express it,  
or he inadvertently says something else,  
or he is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything or not.
As soon as certain topics are raised,  
the concrete melts into the abstract,  
and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed:  
prose consists less and less of words chosen for the sake of their meaning,  
and more and more of phrases tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house."

[Peterson ALSO cites Orwell, weirdly enough][14] (14-Video)  
"I grew up reading orwell, animal farm, 1984, warning against totalitarianism.  
he's been a hero of mine consistently"

[1984, neat.][16]  
📖👀 (16)
"it [is] clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction --  
indeed, in some sense WAS the destruction --  
of a hierarchical society.
If it once became general,  
wealth would confer no distinction.  
It was possible,  
no doubt,  
to imagine a society in which wealth,  
in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries,  
should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste.  
But in practice such a society could not long remain stable.  
For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike,  
the great mass of human beings,  
who are normally stupefied by poverty,  
would become literate and would learn to think for themselves;  
and when once they had done this,  
they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function,  
and they would sweep it away.  
In the long run,  
a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance."

[Jordan Peterson on Hierarchy][15]  
"when the left goes too far and says no hierarchies WRONG"  

blah blah equality of outcome
Maybe don't cite an Anarchist as one of your biggest influences  
if you intend to advocate for strict hierarchies of power.

[For completeness, and the lulz, Jordan Peterson referencing Alice in Wonderland just like Sowell and Friedman][19] (19-Video)  
"So, in alice in wonderland"

Anyway, I don't think I am going to find an example of someone arguing for equality of outcome or result.  
I don't think anyone actually argues for that  
Equality of provision, sure?  
but it's not like everyone is looking for the same outcome with their work  
This stuff is starting to sound kinda conspiratorial,  
and I'm afraid I'm going to run into globalist conspiracy theorizing.  
So... Let's talk about the actual SOURCE of this myth  
Milton Friedman  
See if I can drag this nightmare back into alignment

## The Mirror  
[Milton Friedman's "Free To Choose"][17b] (17b) was a Video Series and Book of the same name  
Let's see his justification for this set of assertions and assumptions.

"is there any distinction between the inheritance of property  
and the inheritance of what at first sight looks very different.  
These youngsters have inherited wealth not in the form of stocks or bonds but in the form of talent.  
This 15 year old boy is an extremely talented cellist..."

🤦‍♀️

I'm sure just about anyone can become an accomplished cellist,  
by the age of 15, based entirely on their ta- are you serious?  
you chose a minimum three-thousand dollar instrument for this argument?  
christ.  
I see why Sowell used the basketball example now.  
At least it's an affordable hobby for The Poors who don't have  
Generational Wealth like having access to a F\*\*\*ING CELLO  

[the book has a chapter about Equality and a subsection on Equality of Outcome][18] (18)  

but... I've already addressed all of the strawmen used in this book  
thanks to weird conspiracy web2.0 sites and Jordan Peterson.  
I'm sorry.  
(again, 2021 me feels very attacked right now with that "web2.0" comment)

If I had to boil this argument down to something digestible, it would have to be:  
"The Founding Fathers wrote equality into the constitution, but that meant equality before god  
We then achieved equality of opportunity in the late 19th early 20th centuries  
Then, the writings of Karl Marx and the consequent failure of the USSR are calling for equality of outcome  
Since this is the case,  
it must be assumed that the Democrats are advocating for Equality of Outcome as a ruse for government control  
As a consequent result of this,  
feminism has gone from the liberation of women to the utopian egalitarian ideal  
This has lead to words meaning things other than what they literally mean or used to mean  
Therefore,  
"The Left" is trying to destroy western civilization through postmodern neomarxist feminism  
Because "The Left" advocates for equal access to  
education,  
housing,  
food,  
and healthcare."  

Okay.  

If that's really the game you are playing, I have to concede  

Because that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard  
And I await people trying to tell me that this isn't what these people are saying  
Because I have cited my sources  
ALL of my sources  
Right under my patreon and twitter links  
And I haven't even made a claim  
I'm just trying to figure out where the hell this argument came from,  
and all I can discern is that it's a strawman conspiracy theory that is frequently conjured to fearmonger  
about government control in service of furthering authoritarianism, which is, in fact, government control.  
I wanted this to be a short video, man. I really did.

## Errata

So when I was reading off that list on that wacky conspiracy site,  
I stopped when I got to entry 7 because it's legitimately the weirdest thing I've ever seen in typing
Enjoy.

Consider the community’s general attitude to truth:  
a civilisation rises because it pursues truth;  
it falls when it suppresses truth.  
Our stance is revealed by the existence of popular delusions,  
whose absurdity has not prevented them from being adopted as truth by governments.  
The list of popular delusions include:

• AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease  
• Affirmative Action is sensible  
• Apartheid is wrong  
• A Big Bang created our cosmos  
• Children must not be smacked  
• CFCs cause a hole in the Ozone layer  
• Courts uphold justice  
• DDT must be banned  
• Democracy is sane rule  
• Global Warming is man-made  
• Jobs for all is essential  
• Mad Cow Disease makes beef toxic  
• Multiculturalism is sane  
• Obesity won by over-eating???  
• Political Correctness is justice  
• Stolen Generations exist  

And Just Wow.  
Woof.  
What the heck.
