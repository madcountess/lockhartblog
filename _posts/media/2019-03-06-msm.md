Ahoy hoy, I'm Luna.  
These days I hear complaints about The Mainstream Media and Liberal Media  
(Though I'd avoid "Liberal Media" as a term,  
since accepting the definition of Liberal from episode 1,  
you'll see that it's not technically wrong,  
but thanks to its origins it IS still a dogwhistle, hence its exclusion.)  
So. What is the Mainstream Media?

_>	Mainstream Media (n.): News and Entertainment outlets  
that propagate the views and narrative of those already in power,  
or those barely out of sync with power.

That is pretty simple, the established main stream's media.  
So, what's the problem?

## Warmongering

"[We see these beautiful pictures at night][01] (01-Video),  
from the decks of these two us navy vessels in the eastern Mediterranean.  
I am tempted to quote the great leonard cohen 'I am guided by the beauty of our weapons'  
um and they are beautiful pictures of fearsome armaments"

Geez, man. I knew Brian Williams was off the deep end, but daaaaamn.  
That boy thirsty.  
For a missile.  
fired at people.  

"What did they hit?"  

people... presumably...  
I mean, [at least Fox TRIED to have fun with that kind of thing!][02] (02-Video)  
TAKE IT AWAAA-  

(footage of bombs dropping on settlements)  
"That is what freedom looks like, that's the red white and blue"  
"one of my favorite things in the 16 years I've been here at fox news is watching bombs drop on bad guys"  

-AAAyyhh ugh.  
Okay.  
that was kinda fucked up.  
They basically just cheered footage of people being killed indiscriminately.  
Why the hell are we even IN the middle east?  
Well, if you ask me, it's because public opinion was wrenched into place  
by media outlets with a vested interest in the war in iraq itself.  
How?  
[By framing the war as inevitable][03] (03-Video)  
[while refusing to platform anti-war sentiment at all.][04] (04-Video)  

"in that news conference, the president committed, win or lose, to a vote next week at the un sec council.  
he said it was time for the world to show its cards when it comes to saddam hussain,  
and mister bush also made clear, perhaps defiantly so, that if he loses that does not mean he will go to war.  
in the president's words 'when it comes to our security, we don't really need anybody's permission'"

(montage of anti-aircraft fire, sirens, tracer fire, and green footage)  
"Saddam Hussain is trying to get fake American and British military uniforms so the Iraqi President can issue them"

Of Course! CNN. I knew it!  
Pinacle of conspicuous thumb twiddling!  

[MSNBC "Supported The War -Joe Scarborough"][05] (05-Video)  
"I want to make a point friends.  
I supported this war from the very beginning and I tell you that all the time,  
I continued supporting it up until the golden mosque was blown up in samora  
and suddenly it DID turn into a civil war there is little left that we can do to win this war in iraq  
UNLESS you and I as taxpayers tell people in washington dc  
'we want to raise enough money to send 300-400k troops over there to subdue iraq for the next 10 years.'  
If we decide we want to do that we can win this war!  
If we don't do that, and there's no way we're gonna do that, we can't win the war."

Of Course! MSNBC. You put... a lot of thought into that hypothetical, didn't you Joe?

[Via Fox][06] (06-Video):  
"what do you think of this new resolution?  
the united states and brittain is going back to the UN again  
and now they've decided they're not even going to put in a timetable here.  
I am concerned that it is only going to embolden and empower saddam hussain  
and allow him to get his troops to dig in so they're gonna hurt our troops.  
I think this may be a very big mistake!  
we're gonna win this victory.  
tragically, we will lose american lives, but it will be brief.  
we're gonna find out massive evidence of weapons of mass destruction  
and we're gonna find the incredible brutality that this dictator has inflicted upon the Iraqi people."

[Via NBC][07] (07)
"In his final word, the CIA’s top weapons inspector in Iraq said Monday  
that the hunt for weapons of mass destruction has “gone as far as feasible”  
and has found nothing, closing an investigation into the purported programs of Saddam Hussein  
that were used to justify the 2003 invasion."

Of C-Who is even PAYING these people?

## Profiteering

[General Electric Ad][08] (08-Video)  

GE, General Electric, interesting.  
Looks like they do medical devices, fridges, and planes.  
Wait, I thought the people who made planes was Boeing...  
huh. So, Boeing ALSO advertised on MSNBC, CNN, and Fox  

["Horizons" is the next step in Boeing's long-range advertising strategy designed to convey the broad scope of the company.][09] (09)  
'We are closing the gap between the public's perception of Boeing  
and the true breadth of our business as a global aerospace company,'  
said Anne C. Toulouse, vice president of brand management and advertising for Boeing."

Public... Perception... I... so it's propaganda?

[Boeing Ad][10] (10-Video)

Was that a stealth bomber? Hold the phone!  
These Companies don't even sell anything YOU can buy.  
other than fridges... which didn't seem to be the focus there,  
so why the hell would they waste money advertising war planes to people in 2002?  
Right when the Iraq War... the second... nevermind,  
right when that debacle was getting started.  
It's not like they made any money off that war, right?  

[Via Boeing Press Room:][11] (11)
"Boeing Wins Navy RTCASS Production Contract!  
The U.S. Navy has awarded Boeing [NYSE:BA] a $31.9 million contract  
for the design and production of a Reconfigurable Transportable Consolidated Automated Support System (RTCASS)  
to support existing Consolidated Automated Support System weapons system test program sets.  
This contract has a total potential value of more than $200 million over a seven-year period."

[Via Geaviation][12] (12) [(Followup)][13] (13)
"LYNN, Massachusetts--GE Aircraft Engines (GEAE)  
has been awarded a $510 million performance-based logistics (PBL) contract by the U.S. Navy.  
The contract covers repair and overhaul of 36 components for F404-400/-402 rotor and stator assemblies,  
plus designated controls and accessories."  

Oh wait.  
they did make money off that war.  
And then that same Mainstream media tries to downplay the protests of people who would  
[rise up against THIS establishment system to challenge their meticulously spun narrative.][14] (14-Video)  

"the decision to release me came from far above.  
this is not a system program director who decided to separate me from MSNBC.  
they were terrified of the anti-war voice and that is not an overstatement.  
anti war voices were not popular.  
and if you're general electric you certainly don't want an anti-war voice on a cable channel you own.  
Donald Rumsfeld's your biggest customer"  
"We did have the NBC memo, the secret memo,  
that said they didn't want their flagship show to be you when the other networks were waving the american flag"  
"I was replaced by Michael Savage"  

[Michael Savage Clip][25] (25-Video)
"we need a nationalist party in america... they need a charismatic leader"
(Hitler Picture)

uh... wow.

The message being given is "don't protest" because spin doesn't hold up to scrutiny, and the evidence...

["the hunt for weapons of mass destruction has {...} found nothing"][07] (07)

Let's just say that "found nothing" doesn't look good.  
As far as protest goes, it's not just the higher ups who spin right round.  
To the No Spin Zone!

## The Civility Trap

[Via Fox:][15] (15-Video)  
"some of the occupy protesters are well-intentioned folks  
who believe the financial system is no longer fair, that's a legitimate debate.  
But they have been overrun by thugs, anarchists, and the crazies who intimidate.  
If you are a violent person, people usually back off.  
So the occupy wall street movement is dead.  
Finished as a legitimate political force in this country.  
and that's a good thing."

Oh no, not the "crazies who intimidate" Bill, anything but the "crazies."  
Sometimes protest is kinda intimidating, you snowflake.  
This is pretty standard discreditation procedure.  
Downplay the goals, downplay the voices, downplay the facts of reality, and spin spin spin.  

[I wonder how many publicly traded companies sponsor this channel][16] (16)

quite a few, it turns out.  
Regardless, it's not all about Sponsorships and Investors.  
Even if they're biased by money, most of their bias comes from the system in which they operate.  
This is The "Liberalism" Framework in action.  
All they want is for everyone to just .... come on guys.  
come on with the protest.  
against the system.  
come on.  
why can't we just be civil guys?  
come on now, guys.  
This is why you will see all this "but civility" crap on the big 3 on a near constant basis.

[montage: Sarah Sanders Tweet, Maxine Speaks, "Encourage Harassment", mister rodgers, ripping babies][17] (17-Video)  

What Jake Tapper and his Friend here are complaining about is protesting.  
Protesting is a right, hell, it's a DUTY at times, and we can't just dehumanize people with whom we don't agree!  
Y'all, the 1st amendment is the 1st amendment is the 1st amendment,  
and trying to invalidate the freedom to organize and speak out is shameful.  

[CNN "Jail Maxine Waters"][18] (18-Video)  
"maxine waters. I call her the hustler of hate.  
promoting hate and division and actually attacking the administration  
or anybody who's involved with this administration. that's unheard of,  
she should [be] put behind bars and throw away the key."

But these people are shameless.  
Speaking of shameless:  

[Fox "RESPECT TED CRUZ"][19] (19-Video)

RESPECT TED... NO!  
Not even Ted Cruz's daughters respect Ted Cruz, why should anybody?  
Something feels missing here.  
I feel like I need a Ted Cruz joke.  
Trevor?

[Via Daily Show "Antifa Are Bad Too"][20] (20)
"You've got these antifa members who believe that smashing shit is all they should do,  
others want to expose neo-nazis, and part of antifa has only been about videogames,  
but the part that's been causing the most headaches is the one that's hitting people in the head"

Oh, get bent.

## Not So "Liberal" After All

So, shows like The Daily Show try to come off as being leftish,  
but remember that Liberal does not mean "leftish"  
so accusations of Liberal Media aren't -technically- wrong if you're referring to Liberalism,  
but as for leftish?

[Daily Show "But How Will You Pay For Socialism, Alexandria?"][21] (21-Video)

Well she has a plan up with numbers, Jake's got the numbers.  
News dude, show him what's up.

[CNN "TELL US EVERYTHING YOU WROTE A HUGE THING ABOUT THAT WOULDN'T FIT RIGHT NOW! FAST!"][22] (22-Video)

UGH.  
JAKE.  
Okay, for context.  
Alexandria is not looking at the fancy graphics package on the screen there, Jake.  
She is looking at a camera, Jake.  
[She also has entirely different numbers for this situation, Jake.][23] (23)

"Under current law,  
national health spending is projected to grow at an average rate of %5.5 per year for 2017-26  
and to reach $5.7 trillion by 2026.  
While this projected average annual growth rate is more modest than that of %7.3 observed  
over the longer-term history prior to the recession (1990-2007),  
it is more rapid than has been experienced 2008-16 (4.2 percent)."

which makes 48.4 trillion.  
wow.  
and technically over 9 years, not 10  
Do we have footage of Jake asking the same questions about the republican health proposal?  
No?  
He was focused on coverage?  
Great.  
Trevor?  
Just the nothing?  
Cool.  
If you know of a clip of these charlatans questioning the 10 year spending cost for a pro-corporate idea.  
show me.  
so if i'm reading this right medicare for all will save us sixteen trillion dollars.  
Makes me wonder what we could spend that money on... Hannity? any ideas?

[FOX "AOC Wants You To Have Housing And Senior's Benefits"][24] (24-Video)

Sean, you have senior citizens in your audience and you told them she would help them.  
good work.  
Don't challenge the main stream, apparently.  
They really don't like that.  
There's a positive note, right?  
There's like, literally A reason to trust the institution of Journalism, right?  

##	"Fake News"
Okay, to be honest, there are pretty much nothing but issues with main stream media and its biases.  
I personally think the biggest issue is the framing.  
Mainstream media is corporate media, and corporate media serves corporate interests.  
The framework provided by corporate media posits good and evil, and insists that corporations are good, not evil.  
I'm going to make a video about framework as a concept, so put a pin in that word.  
If there's a take-away here, it's to check sources. In fact, it's why I put my bibliography in the description.  
If you want to be informed, it's going to take work, and most of that work is asking questions.  
So, I guess, ask questions, do your own research, and examine your own biases.  
Also, if you want non-corporate news, there's wonderful places all over the internet like ProPublica.  
There are journalists out there with different frameworks, and I encourage you to seek them out.  
They may have a smaller fact-check team, they might support a political party overtly,  
but allowing our default framework to be what corporations want is giving up our collective reality for a constructed one.  
Wow that's a bummer ending right there.
