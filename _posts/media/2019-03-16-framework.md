Settle down, class.  
Today's topic is Framework.

## Part 1: Polarization

"You're either with us or you're against us" is extraordinarily obvious in its intent to polarize,  
and it's pretty easy to reject the premise out of hand.  
Whereas something like "Pro Life vs Pro Choice" is a little more obfuscated.  
The debate here is whether or not a person can legally follow their doctor's advice.  
The "choice" here isn't the problem, it's the stakes for which these sides fight.  
You can have debates over the morality of choosing to abort a fetus for a variety of reasons,  
but thanks to modern medicine, abortion is fairly easy to do, and safely,  
and is an important tool in reproductive health, so morality is immaterial.  
Morality is personal and anything but concrete, so if you want your laws to be moral,  
you cannot have any laws that go against any moral hangups in the entire society.  
Does that sound even somewhat reasonable?  
If not to that extent,  
say that the moral majority gets to choose what's acceptable and what is abhorrent behavior.  
Would THAT be reasonable?  
What if the moral majority gets to choose what's acceptable to talk about in polite society?  
Well.  
Are you okay with killing babies?  
Welcome to framework 101.  
If you answered that question, you are not paying attention.

## Part 2: Neutralization

You good? That was a lot to take in, I'm sure.  
I don't know about you but, all that emotional charge?  
That's really going to get in the way of the issue, so we will use distancing language

First type of distancing language today: Euphemism.  
Anti-Choice is really charged and echoes of eugenics, so Pro-Life was chosen as a foil.  
a farce.   
a ruse.  
Being Pro-Choice doesn't make you Anti-Life.  
We can all pretty much agree that a healthy child is a good thing to have going on.  
so what, might I ask, is insinuated by the term 'Pro-Life'?  
This movement wants us to think in terms of Pro versus Anti-Life,  
since "Anti-Life" is just a weirdly PC euphemism for having murderous intent,  
and so far, the framework has stuck.  
Unfortunately.  

The second type of distancing language today: Depersonalization.  
Bill Clinton said ["I did not have sexual relations with *that woman*"][01] (01-Video)  
George Bush said	["I've never sat down with him and had a discussion with the guy."][02] (02)  
This Movement.  
The Guy.  
That Woman.  
An Employee.  
The Perpetrator.  
This phrasing aims to remove culpability by distancing a person's actions from their name.  
It's hard to talk about Depersonalization without talking about...

The third, and final, type of distancing language for this video: The Passive Voice.  
Passive voice is putting forth the notion that a thing happened and doesn't inform anyone on who did it or why.  
Herald didn't attempt to run his kids over, Herald's kids were nearly struck by a car.  
This shifts the blame from the person to the object, so the person is never at fault.  
To demonstrate Passive Voice, as well as Euphemism and Depersonalization,  
I have mocked up a news article about a real event.  
Do note that these are examples and not actual news articles.  

Killeen, TX |  
14 injured, 4 dead after incident involving a disgruntled government employee following a scheduling dispute.  
The perpetrator was found dead from self-inflicted injuries  
while the 14 injured people were rushed to medical facilities for treatment.  
An investigation into the perpetrator's mental state at the time was conducted, but was ultimately inconclusive.

Since I do have further information on this "incident"  
I will now read this back to you without the neutral filters.

[Killeen, TX][03] (03) |  
At Fort Hood, Army Specialist Ivan Lopez opened fire on and killed 3 fellow service members,  
injuring an additional 14 before taking his own life.  
Lopez reportedly was denied a leave of absense by superior officers, leading to a shouting match.  
Lopez reportedly left to smoke a cigarette, and came back inside with his pistol drawn.  
The 3 service members Lopez killed were:  
Sgt First Class Daniel M. Ferguson  
Sgt Timothy W. Owens  
Staff Sgt Carlos A. Lazaney-Rodriguez.

You will see echoes of the first example in most stories of police shooting civilians,  
as the media organizations kinda want to stay on the good side of the police for access.  
Use critical thinking when you run across this type of framework,  
as it can be used to obscure lies or dismiss the facts.

## Part 3: Framework

Welcome to those coming from the [Mainstream Media episode!](https://peoplesbayo.net/2019/03/06/msm.html)  
Hi!  
Now that I have provided you with examples, let's move on to the basic concepts of framework itself.  
A framework is a set of facts, phrasings, and choices made by the speaker in order to present a viewpoint.  
The framework I tend to use for examination is rooted in Holism.  
The holistic viewpoint is that all things are connected,  
and that looking at the big picture without taking into account the individual parts  
and connections between misses the point of looking at the big picture.  
The framework that news networks tend to use is rooted in Neoliberalism.  
The Neoliberal viewpoint places a hierarchy on reality itself,  
positing that the top is good and the bottom is bad,  
because market forces have determined as such.  
Problem episode 1 covered this pretty well, I think.  
But I haven't explained how these frameworks propogate or appear, so it's time for yet another thought experiment:

Do you want A or B?  
Oh, good choice.  
I didn't tell you to make *that* choice.  
You did it on your own.  
We call this "freedom of choice" and you like freedom, right?  
Of course you do.  
It's a shame you didn't pick a number though.  
Freedom of Choice is one way to present a framework.  
By presenting a limited set of options, I have framed this as a choice between A and B without discussing C or D or 5 or Hashtag.  
Mainstream Media presents you with 2 choices, Liberal and Conservative, while dismissing alternative ideologies as non-choices.  
Are you a Republican or a Democrat?  
Oh, good choice.  
I didn't tell you to blah blah you get it.  
By limiting what we see and creating a framework, an MSM news station can direct the narrative to be all about a few talking points.  
Whenever that framework is challenged... well.  
[They tend to do whatever they have to do to make sure it doesn't get aired.][04] (04-Video)    
And if it's not a guest, but an anchor?  

Phil Donahue: "If you're GE, you don't want an anti-war voice when your biggest customer is Donald Rummsfeld."  

They tend to do whatever they have to do to make sure that anchor doesn't get aired.  
I do hope this has cleared up any questions you might have about [Problem Episode 3.](https://peoplesbayo.net/2019/03/06/msm.html)
