Ahoy hoy, I am Luna!  
Today we will talk about the Liberal ideology, so let's get a definition.

*Liberalism (n Political Theory):*  
*An ideology asserting the market's ability to govern itself with supply and demand pressures*

How do Supply and Demand pressures affect The Market?

## Supply and Demand

In a Free Trade market, the price of goods and services  
depends on how much is being offered (supply) and how much people will buy (demand.)  
[In 2015][01] (01), we saw Real Life Goblin  
and winner of Time's "Smuggest Man" award  
4 years running jack up the price of Daraprim by 5500%.  
Now, you might say,  
"ah, so demand must have exploded or supply must have plummeted"  
but no, actually.  
Despite costing 750 USD per pill in the USA,  
you can get them for 5 cents each in India.  
Children have synthesized this life-saving really old drug  
used by AIDS patients and transplant recipients.  
And I do mean OLD.  
This drug was released in 1953.  
Do you know what else was released in 1953?  
The first color television.  
Supply and Demand aren't being used to determine price,  
the price is just being raised so they can make money off an old drug.  
Stockpiling medicine away from people who need it.  
This is, in many cases, a death sentence, so how did this happen?  
Well, that's how The Market works!

## What is "The Market?"

The Market describes a few different things depending on the context.  
A Free Market, as shown above, can get ugly without any protections.  
With no oversight by any non-market entities like watchdog groups  
or regulation committees, this leaves the price of "things" up to  
whoever has "things" regardless of how "needed" those "things" are by "human people."  

[via Marginal Revolution][02] (02) - "Martin Shkreli, of Turing pharmaceuticals,  
noticed that there was only one producer of Daraprim in the United States and,  
knowing how expensive FDA approval is to sell a generic drug,  
saw that he could greatly increase the price."  

Given that Shkrelli's company owns the one company making it,  
they have an effective monopoly on an ancient drug because they are  
Free to use the Market as they wish with nobody to stop them.  
On the other hand, in a Protected market,  
protections are in place for prices and working conditions,  
but where "Free Market" applies otherwise.  
This is implemented in smaller ways by Fair Trade,  
but I won't tell you to only buy Fair Trade,  
as I will go into in a bit here, but it might help.  
I know, I know.  
This is all some garbage from a lazy millennial too entitled to take an entry level job.  
I get that impulse, but lazy and entitled are misleading at best and lies at worst.  

## Millennials and the Death of Industry

As for those entry level jobs, The Job Market is sparse these days,  
entry level positions are rare, and most open positions require college degrees  
most of us can't afford to either enroll or attend without a job... you might see the paradox.  
This means people will take a lower paying job  
just so they can have a job even if it's not enough to live. So, what about "Entitled" then?  
[Let's ask the Job Geniuses at Forbes for THEIR opinion!][03] (03)  

"A study found that people in their 20s are more than  
3 times as likely to have narcissistic personality disorder  
(which is commonly associated with entitlement) than people 65 or older."  

Ah yes, let's just make this a mental health thing.  
What a cool thing to do.  
That sounds like a natural progression of discourse.  
Do you really think being poor is a mental disease?  
Moving on.  

"*The Bad*"
"Entitled people are more likely to demand higher pay.  
They believe they’re worth more than their counterparts for no objective reason,  
and may demand a higher salary accordingly."

The reason people are demanding higher pay isn't because they think they're better  
than everyone else, it's because they aren't being paid enough to LIVE HERE and they WANT TO LIVE.  
Being entitled to your own life isn't entitlement, it's self-preservation you git.  

"*The Ugly*"
"There’s also a dark side to the individual effects of entitlement.  
Researchers from Case Western Reserve University found that entitlement  
typically leads to chronic disappointment; you feel like you deserve  
certain things, whether tangible or intangible, yet you never get them,  
so you always leave a situation with unmet expectations.  
People then feel frustrated, unhappy, and overall disappointed with life,  
and cope with this by blaming others—rather than themselves—to continue  
feeling that it’s the environment that’s responsible for their disappointment.  
Over time, this can lead to clinical depression and isolation."  

Dude, stop blaming workers for the jobs YOU GAVE THEM!  
This isn't talking about entitlement,  
it's just victim-blaming the workers for not being paid well enough.  
Also: "blaming others-rather than themselves"  
says the man blaming an entire group of people for the situation in which he put them.  
BRA-VO.  

The NCAA employs many millennials to play pretty strenuous games  
in exchange for attending the school for which they play.  
Those scholarships are basically unused since sports takes up  
90% of their energy and they're given filler courses like swahili,  
so they ARE getting paid, right?  
Like, enough to live while they're players? for the sports?  
with the money? that they make? from the sports? well...  
The NCAA has been stating for years that paying their college players  
for their contribution to the industry would be antithetical to the sport.  
[This guy agrees with me on this:][04] (04)  

"Personally, I understand that football and basketball players whose talents  
bring in the bulk of the money deserve some of it."

Damn straight, gotta pay the workers!

"I also know that there is no practical way to implement a pay-for-play system  
that would not bankrupt virtually every athletic program in the NCAA.  
In reality, you could not get away with paying just the star players."

buhhh what?  
Let's check that  

At the time this was written, the NCAA was making [627 million dollars a year][05] (05).  
What is it now?

[1.1 billion?][06] (06)  
That's as many as one thousand one hundred millions, and that's just terrible.  
That is a frankly ridiculous amount of prof-what.  

"Operates as a non-profit"

No, that can't be right.  
But let's assume he's somehow right.  
They make so much money, that to say they made a billion dollars  
is excluding 100 million dollars, but can't pay the students.  
Whatever.  
What do you suggest, John Smallwood?  

"Let kids get paid for autographing memorabilia if someone wants to pay them.  
In other words, let the free market determine who gets paid and who doesn't."

I... I need backup.  
This is no longer Liberalism.  
This has become something much darker.  
IT'S!

## NEOLIBERALISM!

-- Neoliberalism (n Political Theory) A form of liberalism  
that extends the power of the market to society at large, and asserts  
that progress can be made through market forces  

What do I mean by society at large?  
Well, if you live somewhere and the laws suck, you can just move!  
That isn't prohibitively expensive or disruptive to your life.  
No way, not a chance.  
At least [that seems to be the opinion of Craig Berlin][07] (07) over at the "Independent Voter Network" Quote:

"In a country whose Constitution was designed primarily to protect individual liberty,  
it’s surprising how much we’ve become interested in telling others how to live.  
Moving from one city to another or one state to another  
to a community we find more suitable isn’t unusual or particularly difficult,  
relatively speaking in comparison to leaving the country or living in a state of constant anguish."

Wait, why the hell are YOU telling people how to live!?  
You just???  
What would be the purpose of moving away instead of trying to fix the system?  
Apparently, we should:

"Let communities and states compete in the marketplace of ideas  
and reevaluate what we should be trying to do as a national block."

oh my god.  
Market forces aren't some one-size-fits-all solution, seeing as most (if not all) cure-alls cure nothing.  
The issue here is that people are giving up their self-ownership to take part in a game  
in which they can not win simply because they weren't born with enough currency to make the playoffs.  
Applying these same forces to social issues means giving quantifiable value  
to a person's social aspects and ehhhhhhhh that isn't good.  
Social aspects include:

Race, Gender, Age, Sexuality, Psychology, Physical Ability, and Class

We don't have full control over these aspects, so our value is decided for us,  
which means we're basically popping a dollar into a change making machine and hoping it gives us back a million.  
Unless all of those immutable aspects line up for the highest value within that system,  
your value is intrensically lower.  
Forever.  
This is what many people refer to as Meritocracy,  
and like to pretend that working hard will get you ahead, but that's not what merit means.  
Merit-worthy doesn't mean "worked the hardest" it means  
"deemed worthy of praise for meeting a standard" and the people on top who get to choose  
what that standard is tend to look for reflections of themselves instead of  
a new perspective or god forbid "an abnormal."

The idea that a marketplace can accurately represent the broad field of "thought and experience"  
is quite frankly laughable, and the idea that a marketplace can produce the best of the best  
assumes that the people who own all parts of business are worthy of godhood.  
And that... just doesn't hold water.  
Look... I don't want you to think that I'm saying "if you're a liberal, you are a bad"  
and I'm not telling you to not strive for fair trade.  
what I am saying is that the people who identify as Liberal frequently don't explore the ideology of Liberalism.  
I think if they did, they would find many things incongruous  
with their own values, like how Fair Trade can't compete against Free Trade.  
Perhaps, if you identify liberal, you should look into...  
I dunno, progressive, democratic socialist, just democrat?  
whatever.  
Not my job to pick your labels, right?  
Explore the ways you can help others outside the market,  
because as long as we participate IN the market,  
we will be stuck with whoever has the most money's morality as law.  
Though the market may be free,  
under it,  
WE are not.
