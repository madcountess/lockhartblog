Ahoy hoy, I'm Luna, the People's Bayonet!  
That's peoplesbayo.net!  
Comin' at you as-live from occupied Georgia!  
My friends, my family, my fellow new southerners.  

Questions:

1 All currency at this point is pretty much fiat, but Cyrpto seems especially susceptible to the issues of fiat currency (hyper inflation and volatility). Are there any actual safe gaurds protecting against this? Is there truly no upper limit to the number of units any given currency can have? As power and processing grows what safegaurds are there so that mining doesn't increase as, at my understanding, currently new coins just require more processing?
2 In your opinion what is it about cryptocurrency that attracts dudes who idolize Elon musk? Obviously not everyone in crypto is like that, but it definitely seems to attract a certain kind of person
3 Is there any actual use cases for NFTs that can't be done better by stuff we already have?
4 And another question, how much of a grift is ethereum's web3? Cause to my eye, without much technical knowledge, it doesn't seem to offer a significant difference to existing structures/won't deliver on its promise of a decentralized network/apps, and payment for running nodes/machine time is nebulous.
5 Couple questions if I'm allowed: Which coins were your favorite to focus on? Also, did you do your own mining or just play the exchanges mostly?
6 why should i pay for an NFT when i can right click copy and save as?

Answers:

1 there are indeed upper limits on a lot of coins, but there are almost no safeguards against hyperinflation, volatility, or power concerns! I will answer this further in detail in the script
2 interestingly, I kinda have already answered this in-script, so it's pretty simple to answer: because cryptocurrency is an ultimately reactionary market system that idolizes hero figures who have done nothing notable besides throw around stupid amounts of capital at-whim
3 No. NFTs are a scam from tip to tail, and I'm surprised it's not dead yet
4 unfortunately, I don't know all that much about Ethereum as a platform. I know about tokens, and I know about the coin itself, but the Dapps never really interested me during my stint in microcapital
5 good questions! I invested in QBASE, BTC of course, and ALGO (and I still have some money tied up in ALGO) and I did mine until FPGSs pretty much ejected most graphics cards from the mining market. I mostly have played exchanges since then in a probably misguided attempt at recouping losses incurred during my active days
6 you literally should never pay for an NFT. They're a scam from tip to tail.

Prewrite:
I curse my time in crypto, I wish it had never happened,  
but boy does a lot of my analysis of capitalism stem from my intense,  
integrated experience of the cryptocurrency world.
I remember being told that I was the only person interested in a specific mining pool's community,  
everyone else was only in the discord for commands and help, and never gave any help.  
I ended up a moderator for almost every public mining pool's discord at one point or another.  
I watched people talk about people as property,  
about "the problem with bitches / fags / n*****s / trannies,"  
about parasitic cripples,  
about Jews running everything,  
about communists destroying society,  
basically everything short of 1488.  
At that point in time, I was very much a self-described anti-fascist, I figured fascism and capitalism were separate beasts. I hadn't put it together yet, but it became very clear that what I was steeping myself in was a reactionary market, because markets are reactionary. what clicked so loudly to me back then, and what has gotten me criticism since, is that these people had no motivation to better themselves through anything but competition. They needed a death to the egregore of capital, and freedom from their compulsions, not a lecture on how they're using problematic language in pursuit of exploitative goals. They were compelled to act in service of capital, because they were told that they would be allowed to act AS capital, but nothing could be further from the truth.
The harder you work, the more you break your body and mind, the less chance you have of "success."
The people who do work their way up from abject poverty and become multi-millionaires don't tend to be the people who worked the best, but the ones who are the most competitive, cutthroat, deceitful, slanderous charlatans this side of the void.
The easiest way to get ahead is to make other people fight each-other. You start rumors, you redirect retribution onto your competitors, and you cut deals behind the scenes to drown your competitors in violations and turmoil.
It was insane watching it happen as a leader.
I was asked to intervene in a fight to make it stop, and the person who contacted me had started it and let other people fight over it.
They stirred the pot and stepped away and didn't even delete the message.
Amateur, I thought, but it kept happening with others.
the competitive nature of these crypto-miners was obscene, but it was a complete and utter joke in comparison to the competitive nature of the showrunners.
I got involved in multiple crypto startups, as a miner, and a supporter for the stated goals, and time after time after time after time the moment it hit a trading platform, the founders were not just absent, but completely vanished.
Then someone would go "he's done this before"
The Showrunners know each-other, and their goals are much more in line, than any of us were allowed to know, and the one time I got to see it as a moderator kinda broke all of my desire to participate in markets or startups or crypto ever again.
the infighting alone was bad enough, but the sniping and open embezzling within the mod area is what killed it for me.
They had no intentions on letting anybody know what was happening until the trap was already sprung and there was nothing to save, and no way out.
it wasn't even ingenious.
these people weren't smart.
they were just competitive, deceptive, and almost pathologically incapable of sympathy.
they were ruthless, and they let one guy take the fall, and the fall guy was in no way innocent, but neither were the rest of 'em.
Crypto is just a microcosm of Capitalism.
Bitcoin was supposedly created to escape from capital's grasp on capital, to avoid trading and markets, but here we are, a good 12 years later, and bitcoin just "rallied" to raise the crypto market capacity to 2 trillion US dollars.
After all the fluff NVIDIA put out about how their segregation of Graphics Cards from Mining Cards would keep Graphics Cards out of the hands of Miners, it turns out that segregation doesn't actually stop cross-over, it just delays it or slows it down.

To a working unity, my friends.  
Solidarity forever. âœŠ
