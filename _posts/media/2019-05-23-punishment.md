I've been kinda deep in the internet recently because of a clip that arose a month or two ago.  
In fact, I don't know how much of this someone might not know because I've been so deep in it,  
so let me define some things real quick like.  
Truancy is repeatedly skipping school,  
Deterrent is a thing that makes you not do a thing,  
and rehabilitation... is guided self-care?

Perhaps I should... just... sorry...

##	A Bad Cop  

So, a friend of a friend posted this on twitter.  
Now, depending on where you're coming from, this clip can sound like Yanny or Laurel

[Kamala Harris on Truancy and Punishment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhJwmIPRmYk) (youtube)  
"As a prosecutor in law enforcement I have a huge stick  
the school district has got a carrot  
let's work in tandem around our collective objective and goal  
which is to get those kids in school  
I believe that a child going without education is tantamount to a crime  
so I decided I was going to start prosecuting parents for truancy"  


Yan..no definiely laur... Cop.  
She's a cop.  
Oh boy she's a cop.  
Anyway. That was interesting to hear from now presidential candidate Kamala Harris  
Without making the assumption that going to school is a moral good on its own,    

[what is the actual problem with Truancy?][01] (01)  

" In the long-term, evidence reveals truancy as a predictor of poor adult outcomes,  
including violence, marital instability, job instability, adult criminality, and incarceration.  
Moreover, truancy exerts a negative effect on community because of its correlation with  
delinquency, crime, and other negative adult outcomes"

Definitely some things to avoid there, wow.  
Okay, let's fix it. Let's do this. What was your plan?

[Kamala Harris on Truancy and Punishment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhJwmIPRmYk) (youtube)  
"on my letterhead, let me tell you something about my letterhead  
when you're the DA of a major city in this country, usually the job comes with a badge  
and there is often an artistic rendering of said badge on your stationary  
so I sent out a letter on my letterhead to every parent in the school district  
a friend of mine actually called me and he said "kamala my wife just got the letter  
she freaked out' she brought all the kids into the living room' held up the letter, said  
"if you don't go to school, kamala's gonna put you AND me in jail"  
yes we achieved inten- intended effect!"


Well... let me check the causes real quick before we go throw some kid's parents in jail

In a meta-analysis of [the causes, effects, and solutions for truancy by Bill Rivers,][01] (01)  
he splits the causes into 4 groups.  
family factors, school factors, economic influences, and student variables.  
Family Factors is like, household income, parental supervision, education, stuff like that  
thirty percent of kids skipping school had nobody at home for five plus hours after school,  
where only eleven percent always had supervision after school,  
strongly suggesting a link between supervision and school attendance.  
Thirty Three percent of kids skipping class in high school did not live with their parents.  
fourteen percent lived with both.

Uh... did... did I just dunk on Kamala Harris?  
Because if parental supervision leads to less truancy...  
And your solution to truancy is to remove the parents...  
That means your entire premise is based on a contradictory strategy!  

More? Okay... 2 points of data isn't enough for y'all privileged punks...  

Income, right?  
So, students are more likely to skip school if they live in a family that makes less than fifteen thousand a year.  
That means, under Kamala's plan, if you are poor, your child is more likely to get both of you imprisoned.  

"School factors that may cause truant behavior include, but are not limited to school climate, class size,  
attitudes, ability to meet each student’s diverse needs, and the school’s discipline policy regarding truancy."

And, if you're poor, you're more likely to live in an area with larger classes and fewer specialists  
If you're REALLY screwed, NO specialists.  
So, basically, if you are disadvantaged, you are at severe risk of punishment.  
This creates an environment of fear that isolates students from their education,  
making them feel alien among fellow students, especially if the parents get arrested.

##	Isolation
Okay, let's say you're fine with that.  
It gives a good motivation to make sure your children go to school.  
Or, at least that's what is proposed in the prosecutor's framework.  
In that framework, let's look at isolation as a punishment.  
In 1890, when someone's unjust extra punishment while on death row was raised to the Supreme Court,  
we were given a [concise opinion from the court about the effects of isolation:][02] (02)  

"A considerable number of the prisoners fell, after even a short confinement, into a semi-fatuous condition,  
from which it was next to impossible to arouse them, and others became violently insane, others, still,  
[fell to] suicide, while those who stood the ordeal better were not generally reformed,  
and in most cases did not recover sufficient mental activity to be of any subsequent service to the community."

That's the supreme court.  
We've known for a while.  
Yet, we will throw someone away for for petty theft.  
It's not just criminals, we will throw away american heroes like Chelsea Manning for exposing war crimes  
and refusing to essentially testify against herself... which feels like a 5th amendment issue...  
I'm reminded of [an account of Solitary Confinement from Wilbert Rideau][03] (03),  
a Journalist who served 44 years for manslaughter, of which 12 were cumulatively spent in solitary:

"Deprived of all human contact, you lose your feeling of connectedness to the world.  
You lose your ability to make small talk, even with the guard who shoves your meal through the slot in the door.  
You live entirely in your head, for there is nothing else.  
You talk to yourself, answer yourself.  
You become paranoid, depressed, sleepless.  
To ward off madness, you must give your mind something to do.  
In 1970, I counted the 358 rivets that held my steel cell together, over and over.  
Every time the walls seemed to be closing in on me, I counted them again,  
to give my mind something to fasten on to."

So, no. It tends to make things worse.  
But we're talking about kids, right?  
Nobody is gonna throw kids into solitary confinement, right?  
Sure, but if we put their parents in prison, they'll likely have to deal with MORE isolation,  
and this shows that extreme isolation, or alienation, is not just unhealthy.  
It's explicitly harmful.  
If isolation isn't the correct punishment, what is?  
Is there a form of punishment that serves as an effective deterrent?

##  Punishment

[To go back to the Truancy paper:][01] (01)

"Tobin suggests that imposing more serious punishments has worsened truant behavior;  
thus proving punishment to be counterproductive in the fight against chronic absenteeism."

[from Deterrence Effect of Punishment][04] (04)

"The evidence in support of certainty’s deterrent effect pertains almost exclusively to apprehension probability.  
Consequently, the conclusion that certainty not severity is the more effective deterrent   
is more precisely stated as certainty of apprehension and not the severity of the legal consequence  
ensuing from apprehension is the more effective deterrent."

Severity of punishment doesn't affect deterrence rates  
Length of punishment doesn't affect deterrence rates  
Most of the time, the only deterrent to crime was "I'm gonna get caught if I do this, so I won't."  
Students are already harassed by police for skipping school,  
and cutting out the grey area means having a line where "too absent"  
removes you and your parents from wider society... and it looks like that lasts for the rest of their lives  
And if punishment makes the problem worse, we are going to need a different solution.  
I'll repeat that: Punishment. Does. Not. Work.  
Punishment furthers the divide between people, who have made mistakes,  
and their humanity, both in their perception and in ours.  
What's the solution? I say rehabilitation. Redemption.

[Giving people the tools with which they might grow as a person.][05] (05)  

In a study, by the department of justice, of people arrested for addiction,  
it was shown with sufficient confidence that taking care of people in prison reduces recidivism rates  
by 10 percentage points over 1 year, 12 over 2.  
It was also shown, with sufficient confidence,  
that continuing that care once the prisoners were released reduced recidivism rates by  
33 percentage points over 1 year, 37 over 2.  
I posit that if we started with therapy instead of isolation,  
we could extend this to the entire bloated prison system.  
We can not be held as arbiters of behavioral progress if we make no commitment to social change.  
Look, here's the main thing.  
Depending on sentence, these people will be among us again one day.  
We can't condemn people to life in prison for smokin' pot or skipping school, or god forbid being poor  
They're gonna have to re-integrate into society one way or another.  
[In Wideau's words:][03] (03)

"...every year men from California’s Pelican Bay and other supermax prisons around the nation are released  
directly from the vacuum of their cells into free society, to live and work among you and your loved ones.  
As a matter of self-preservation,  
maybe we should all join the prisoners’ request for rehabilitative opportunities..."

What we are doing is not working, and the best way forward is to restore justice to the justice system.  
To humanize and help  
To rehabilitate and redeem  
To forgive, even if we don't forget  
To lift those who have done wrong from their dark place and help them overcome the stains of misdeed  
that may never wash out, that they might become but a small mark on an otherwise beautiful portrait  
should we choose to simply keep painting instead of burning the canvas and tossing the ashes to the winds.  
It's not that I believe that we are better than this, but that we -can DO- better than this.  
If we want a better world, we have to start first with how we treat those who have done wrong.
