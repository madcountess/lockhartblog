We don't have to tell you things are bad.  
Everybody knows things are bad.  
[It's a pandemic.][04] (04)  
[Everybody's out of work, or scared of losing their job.][08] (08)    
[The dollar buys a nickel's worth,][05] (05)  
[banks and corporations are bleeding us dry through wage][07] (07)  
[and consumption,][06] (06)  
[hospitals charge an arm and a leg to fix an arm and a leg,][14] (14)  
[the cops][01] (01)  
[are running wild][02] (02)  
[in the street,][03] (03)  
[there's nobody in office who seems to listen,][15] (15)  
[and there's no end to it!][10] (10)  
[WE know the air is unfit to breathe.][11] (11)  
[WE know our food is unfit to eat.][16] (16)  
yet we sit around, wasting away while some MainStream 'News'caster tells us  
that today we had FIFTEEN homicides and sixty-THREE violent crimes,  
as if the symptoms are the cause!  
as if THIS is how it's supposed to BE!
We know things are bad â€” worse than bad.  
They're crazy.  
It's like everything everywhere is going CRAZY!  
So we don't go out anymore.  
We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is:  
'Please, at least leave me alone in my bedroom.  
Let me have my smartphone and my laptop and my sub-par internet,  
and I won't say anything!  
Just leave me alone!'  
Well, We're not gonna leave you alone.  
We want you to get MAD!  
We want you to protest,  
We want you to riot,  
We don't want you to write to your legislators,  
because we wouldn't know what to tell you to WRITE.  
We don't know what to do about the pandemic and the inflation and the police and the fighting in the street.  
All we know is that first, you've got to get mad!  

You've got to say: 'We are human beings, goddammit!  
Our lives have value!'  
So, we want you to listen now.  
We want you all to learn how to defend your communities,  
[how to tend to wounds,][09] (09)  
[how to FIGHT.][17] (17)  
We want to show y'all what is wrong and why,  
and we want all of you to spread this knowledge to those you meet,  
because the only way to get this message through is to make it IMPOSSIBLE to ignore!  
Things have got to change.  
But we have to get mad.  
We'll figure out what to do about the pandemic and the poverty and the energy crisis!  
But first, we gotta get MAD!  
And then, we gotta ACT!  
BE an agent of good!  
BE the power invested in you as a HUMAN BEING GODDAMMIT!  
The things you do for the good of humankind, your praxis,  
is not ours to dictate, it is YOURS to determine for your SELF!

We are not the powers that be, but we outnumber them 99 to 1, and we terrify them!  
OUR VOICES TERRIFY THEM!  
OUR BODIES TERRIFY THEM!  
OUR MINDS TERRIFY THEM!  
Is it your fault that you are a terrorist, friend?  
Is the terror you cause intentional?  
Or is the terror they feel a poison of their own making?  
[Rioting.][13] (13)  
[Looting.][12] (12)  
These words are used to demean direct action.  
They think we're being children.  
They think WE are being unreasonable by taking this situation into our own HANDS!  
Are you hungry?  
EAT  
You will be labeled a looter if you steal to save your life,  
so be careful when you do what you must to survive.  
you will be labeled a rioter, a TERRORIST, If you want to change things.  
So be terrifying, and riot.  
You will be branded as a radical for standing up for the rights of others.  
So stand in defiance of oppression.  
You will be called a traitor for daring to question the police and national guard.  
So organize for abolition.  
You will be labeled antifa for saying "no."  
So fight against fascism.  
You will be labeled an anarchist for speaking your mind.  
So speak up, be honest, be kind.  
You must remember that these people have yet to unlearn a strictly competitive mindset,  
because you are no different, you and they are just like us!  
Go forth!  
Get mad!  
Strike the earth with might and tongue, spread the word, and ACT!  
Because we're mad as hell, and we're not gonna take it anymore.  
We're mad as hell, and we'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!  
WE ARE MAD AS HELL.  
AND WE'RE NOT.  
GONNA TAKE IT.  
ANY MORE!

but...  
folks...  
we've gotta fund this operation,  
we might not make it to the end of this month,  
we got a sale going on for the rest of this week on Mind Violence Plus and iodine pills but,  
we're gonna take a short break,  
and we'll be right back with a real actual lizard person,  
eat your heart out David Icke!

**Infowars Break Music blares as video fades

how was the energy?  
you got that on camera right?
