What I'm curious about with this october strike thing is ... who the fuck is running it? They say "complete transparency" on the page, but, they have a brand new twitter account, a private instagram account, and a gmail address for contact.
No names.
Nothing older than July.
The reason I want to know who the fuck is running it is because I'm curious if they have ever studied general strikes before.

How they expect, within 2 months, to have enough support for indefinitely not working or buying things long enough to get ANY of their demands met?
They're asking for the world on a platter and asking anybody who will listen to stand in solidarity with a campaign that doesn't have enough information about:

Industries Involved
Representatives Supporting
Unions Supporting
Staff
Timeline
Support for Strikers
Anything

it's spectacle and nothing more, in a society made from pure spectacle. it's fighting with other, much more well funded efforts to sell you cola and cars and prager U videos.

I want campaigns to educate the public about what we can do today, and what tomorrow could be, but...
Why I personally bristle so much at this campaign being taken seriously is because I've been doing this since 2007.
I've seen it all before, and it rarely amounts to more than a:
"do you remember that thing that we were interested in last year?"
"yeah, that didn't go anywhere."

it's gonna be a no show, and it's gonna dull our senses to the idea of a General Strike.
they rarely remember any of the information because this Education is not backed up with Organization and not named up with Unyielding but Judicious Application of Force.
Unyielding because strike breakers get the wall.
Judicious because we can't just shut down literally everything.
Not Use of force, Application. You do not need to Use a weapon to Apply it, all you need to do is hold it in your hand.

Force.
Not Violence, Force. We don't always need to cause harm to USE Force effectively.
There's legitimately nothing that can get between today and tomorrow if we unite, but we cannot unite overnight.

This requires principles, this requires dedication, and this requires more than just a webpage, with contact info verifiable up to only the beginning of July.

Also, as for the "who the fuck?" it was provided to me...  
Here are screenshots from the discord set up for everything:

This Does Not Bode Well

they need more information on how people who are not working are going to be supported during the proposed strike, on who will be necessary to strike and who will be asked to remain at work, on what economic activities should be halted, and more motivation than a set of bullet pointed facts and demands. it just feels very kony2012 to me.

like the website has a thing about how you can't be fired for striking so there's no risk unless your employer acts illegally
and it links a 39-page explainer
which contradicts it.
because duh.
clearly.
like seriously, you and what fucking army?
strikes work by voting for them
being in a fucking organization
and voting that you WILL BE STRIKING
there's fucking accountability there
there's fucking motivation to strike because you know you will have others for certain
"what force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one, but the union makes us strong"
if you don't have a union, even an unofficial one,
if you do not have something organized,
then you do not have a strike,
you have a walk out,
and you will be fired.
when I say "strikebreakers get the wall," I'm saying this is life or death for everyone involved, that's capitalism.
well, everyone but the owner, unless things have escalated.
if the owners start escalating then you have to rise to meet them
there's no two ways about it, it's a fight, not an argument.
there's a reason the anarchists showed up packing when they went down to haymarket,
they knew the pinkertons knew where they were,  
they knew the picket line was shot down by the pinkertons.
the reason I say force is because the problem with using the word "power" is that it is so nebulous
we aren't asking them to do anything
we're telling them how it's gonna go
they can comply or not, it's not their decision what happens
once the chips are down, we either have to fold or call the bluff, and the bluff is that they can replace their entire staff in time to save the business
those who intend to fold need to be convinced, that's the job of education in organizing
