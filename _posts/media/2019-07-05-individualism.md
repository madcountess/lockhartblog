There's a war on for your individuality, folks!  
It's brutal!  
People competing to see who is the best!  
The taboo of working together!  
And worst of all, the twitters!  
Good lord don't get me started on the twitters!  
Welcome to the problem!  
Let's talk about Individualism!  
HOO RAH!  


##  Competition  
I was going to make a different video, but I felt like The Problem became The Depressing Video,  
and that's not quite what I want to go for.  
So.   
I think it might be best to start with Alfie Kohn, the author of ["No Contest, The Case Against Competition"]
[01] (01)  
When it comes to competition, we Americans typically recognize only two legitimate positions:  
enthusiastic support and qualified support.  
he continues on to suggest that in current society, we encourage and lionize competition while demonizing  
the increasing evidence in favor of co-operation as the most productive mode of education, work, and provision  

"That may sound extreme if not downright un-American.  
But some things aren’t just bad because they’re done to excess; some things are inherently destructive.  
Competition, which simply means that one person can succeed only if others fail, is one of those things."

I'm sure y'all have been "losers" at one competition or another

"Most people lose in most competitive encounters, and it’s obvious why that causes self-doubt.  
But even winning doesn’t build character; it just lets one gloat temporarily.  
Studies have shown that feelings of self-worth become dependent on  
external sources of evaluation as a result of competition:  
Your value is defined by what you’ve done.  
Worse — you’re a good person in proportion to the number of people you’ve beaten."

Now, this is what I mean by lionizing competition  
We praise people who have beaten every other person in their field  
Gained their success by climbing ladders made of daggers stabbed into the backs of colleagues and friends alike.  
Made enemies of their allies, allies of their enemies,  
burned all of their bridges, and salted the earth beneath them.  
That doesn't really sound too healthy.

"Cooperation, on the other hand, is marvelously successful at helping people to communicate effectively,  
to trust in others and to accept those who are different from themselves.  
Competition interferes with these goals and often results in outright antisocial behavior.  
The choice is ours: We can blame the individual[s]who cheat, turn violent, or withdraw,  
or we can face the fact that competition itself is responsible for such ugliness."

Competitive groups are much less likely to succeed as a whole than collaborative groups.  
Think about it: if you had a class assignment,  
would you be more likely to get all of the answers correct if you work together or if you work strictly apart?  
Research shows the "work together" choice to be correct, unsurprisingly.  
You might think "well yeah, but that's cheating!"  
So, why is working together so much better to the point that it's considered cheating?  
also, it's something that comes to us naturally.  
we can't help but co-operate.  

[In a study by Issartel, Marin, & Cadopi (2006),][02] (02) participants were incapable of resisting automimickry,  
the phenomenon described as "a group's innate and automatic copying and synchronizing of actions"  
not that all of that is good, of course, but when utilized properly,  
it can turn a group of strangers into a superorganism known as a group or cadre.  
the effect seems to be strengthened by those sharing similar goals,  
and especially within groups that are accepting of people regardless of who and what they are.  
which brings me to the elephant in the room.  

##	Taboo  
So let's talk about my framework some more.  
I have stated that I use a holistic framework here  
I try to make all the right connections  
I advocate for action that goes beyond the individual  
I advocate for the power of groups  
I dance around "unionize"  
but, I can't say "collectivize" without people coming back with  
"but my identity! MY INDIVIDUALITY!" and...  
\*sigh*  
there's a difference between individuality and individualism  
between a collective reality where you are accepted as you are by everyone around you  
and an individualized reality where everyone is the other,  
a possible threat, a philosophical zombie, an NPC, not even human, just some alien.    
a  hollow reality where even subjective truth is meaningless in favor of a  
constantly correct customized cardboard-cutout consumable counterfeit class consciousness  
a "consumer identity" as it is frequently known.  
a "demographic."  
Yet, whenever I see anything about collectivism in american pop culture,  
it's some individualist hivemind scaremongering nonsense like...

'oh no, the spooky collectivist is gonna change your values and views,  
they're gonna turn you into them!  
and then you're gonna lose your identity!  
Matrix Agents!  
Invasion of the Body Snatchers!  
The Borg!'

when in reality, this is basically what that looks like to holists like myself and collectivists alike:

HEY!
HEY KAREN!
I heard you were good at drums!
Do you want to play drums with us?

Off Screen: "Nice Try Collectivist!  
I know your soros-funded agenda is to keep me from playing my instrument alone,  
with nobody to listen or help me get better!  
CHECKMATE COMMIE!"

like, perplexing flexing but, okay...?  
good luck, lone wanderer.

because it legitimately just means working together instead of competing over every god damn thing.  
Collective action, individual identity.  
Individual action, anonymous identity.  
And with neoliberal hierarchies, we are encouraged to indulge in this alienation from self  
we have to sell our expression just to get by.

##  Selling Out vs Free Expression  
As put by Michael Pearce, Sports Editor for the... [Fenton High School publication "Fenton In Print"][03] (03)  
Listen to kids, man.  
They're the ones who are gonna have to live here when you're gone.  

"People spend hours on their phones taking selfie after selfie,  
searching for one that will receive the most comments[and likes.]  
Feeling good about yourself is not the problem.  
There is nothing wrong with taking a good picture of yourself.  
The problem here is the value that a “like” contains.
What does a like actually mean?  
Absolutely nothing.  
A like is just a number on a picture that increases when someone else double taps on it.  
It is literally worthless.  
Basing self-worth off of Instagram likes is not productive, [and] actually lowers your opinion of yourself.  
Everyone in the world is more than the number of likes they receive.  
If you follow more people than follow you, you are not less of a person; it does not look bad.  
Social media has no rule book."

When we idealize the self instead of accepting that the self is a given,  
we lose out on self-expression that isn't marketable, that won't get us the most likes,  
the most clout, the most followers, the most social capital  
We have marketized the self, given worth to ourselves by way of market forces,  
and this villifies non-standard behavior.  
Are you a beat poet in the 21st century?  
Excellent, cool!  
I may not come to watch you perform,  
but you shouldn't force yourself to value mass appeal and album sales over your liberty of expression.  
If you're doing what you want to do,  
why should you ask the world around you if what you're doing is worthy of fame and fortune?  
Have you ever been in a group you like and contributed a meme you made?  
for free?  
Why?  
Time is money!  
You should be making stuff for fame!  
for wealth!  
for glory!  
put a watermark on it!  
get those likes, those comments, those followers, those subscribers, THAT DOUGH!  
that doesn't seem right.  
Making memes for shiggles is not a bad thing to do.  
doesn't matter where you are on the political spectrum,  
you do this for a group, for a collective, for the joy of yourself and others alike.  
trying to commodify that expression, that communication of shared experience, feels like, viscerally wrong.  

like when we see an artist we like in an advertisement, and we feel betrayed.  
We feel like their expression is fake, but the inevitable result of marketizing any expression is "selling out."  
the artist that made the song in my intro and that ad has 2 notable songs across 2 albums.  
the only ones with any popularity are the ones in commercials.  
And that's probably how the artist can keep making the music they love to make.  
you have to marketize your expression because otherwise, you starve.  
in a market society, you're encouraged to give up your individuality for money.  
either you... sell out... or you... die? in obscurity?  

\*deep breath*

I made a depressing video again, didn't I...  
You shouldn't be forced to choose between starving while being yourself, and surviving by being a puppetmaster,  
controlling your own image less as an authentic expression of self, and more as a brand,  
a marketing object, interchangible with a corporate mascot in every single way.  
Individualist societies don't want us to know that we are human, and that humans are social animals.  
We work best in groups, and we're happiest in communities.  
Contributing to society is essentially a given when society welcomes you with open arms.  
Co-operating and collaborating instead of competing is the best way forward,  
not just on a social level, but on a technological and societal progress level.  
If you want your identity back, dear viewers, you're gonna have to fight for it.  
Is it still depressing?  
I tried.
