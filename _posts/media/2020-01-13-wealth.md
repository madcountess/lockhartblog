On one glorious day, Jeff Bezos was worth 166 Billion Dollars.  
[Bezos’s fortune had been skyrocketing as Amazon shares had soared throughout 2018.][01] (01)  
Through most of the year at that point, Bezos’s net worth had been increasing at an average of roughly $260 million per day.  
Amazon's market cap topped one trillion us dollars.  
[(M. Bison Street Fighter Clip "But for me, it was tuesday")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjZ5I8l32CI)  
well, specifically, 2018, September 4th, which was a tuesday.  
and that's just one of many tales set up to spook you in the night,  
give you a fright, and leave your mind burning with the urge to fight.  
When many have none, and few have all, the food shortages will leave but one last meal...  

(ALL FIGURES ASSUMED TO BE LIQUID ASSETS FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES)  
### 1. Wealth

I apparently hate myself.  
I looked more into that story to see if I could comprehend the size of 260 million dollars in bills,  
but oopsie doodle,  
on the same page it informed me that a trillion dollars stacked one on top of another,  
laid on its side,  
would stretch from the tip of florida straight north into georgia's glorious nether-regions.  
and that didn't help my literally seething hatred for this shit.  
okay how can I visualize this better,  
I can't comprehend miles of paper... how about volume?  
1 million is 20 litres, or "about the size of an airplane bag"  
which means absolutely nothing because that means 260 million dollars is 5.2 cubic meters.  
what does that even look like?  
mmmm...  
[answers.com says it's "The same size as a big... piece of... string."][02] (02)  
why do I click on search results from here?  
well, fuck it.  
I can't even visualize how much that bastard was willing into existence,  
on average,  
per day,  
much less what the hell a trillion would be.  
my point is...  

Well, on a base level, money isn't a great thing.  
it does a lot of bad things as a proxy for power,  
but at least you can comprehend riches,  
cool cars and fancy houses,  
but wealth is beyond.

its incomprehensible form taunts us to try to confront it,  
like an old god watching us go mad in its presence

I think the biggest foe we face in this century is the financial system,  
the debt based economy,  
the giants too big to fail failing none the less,  
and us having to foot the bill for... the greed of... how much was that bailout again?

### 2. Corporate/Government Waste

Okay OKAY  
[according to Deborah Lucas at MIT, the figure is around 498 billion][03] (03)  

that's enough money to:  
-give full rides through medical school to everyone in maine, new hampshire, rhode island, and connecticut  
with a hundred and one thousand scholarships to spare.  
[-sustain one average american life for 24.6 million years,][04] (04)    
[roughly the time since the Oligocene gave way to the Miocene.][05] (05)  
-or just feed the entire 40 million population of the state of california for 4.8 years.

and that's just really painful,  
given that the people who got most fucked over by the banks that got bailed out,  
the uhhhh poor people the banks threw under the bus,  
many of whom starved to death or died from preventable illnesses,  
cool cool cool.

oh, rich, let's find rich.  
I'm sure one of these rich bastards has to give me hope in some way.  
let's see... Enya!  
We... love Enya, right?  
(clip of Enya music)  
mmm I mean it's pleasant I guess,  
what do you have to say for yourself, punk?

[(Enya Interview (Youtube))][06] (06):  
Enya: I was gathering a lot of inspirations,  
because after the 3 years,  
the yearning to be back writing music,  
performing was there,  
so it was beautiful to go into the studio,  
and I didn't know what the inspirations were.  
could be a landscape, a person, a story I heard,  
so it's very exciting to go back to the studio.

Cohost Left: We were talking during the break,  
and one of the greatest inspirations MUST be where you LIVE!

Enya: *nods knowingly* 

Cohost Left: it sounds beautiful!  
you must look out of the windows of your CASTLE and the  
music must FLOW out of your mind-  

HOLD up, CASTLE!?
**sigh  

I need a break

### 3. A Moment, To Breathe

Okay, now, we just...  
breathe in.  
that air you're breathing in is only about 20 percent oxygen at the low end, but breathe easy, since we're born to live here.  
breathe in.  
you should be aware that your breath here is just one of 672 billion you are estimated to take in your lifetime.  
breathe in.  
if breaths were dollars, you wouldn't be able to buy microsoft outright with your last dying breath.  
breathe in.  
bill gates is worth 107 billion,  
so if he spent 250 thousand dollars a day,  
that's a quarter million,  
the rough price for a house in Atlanta,  
for the next 11 years,  
he would still have 100 billion dollars in net worth
breathe in.  
that didn't help at all, how the hell is this helping anybody?  
why is there so much MONEY everywhere and why do so FEW people HAVE IT!?  

### 4. The Point

I consider people like Bezos to be a large part of the problem,  
because I know how little his company pays employees,  
and people are still imagining more money into existence connected to his name than I can wrap my mind around.  
The accumulation of wealth is never going to be used,  
it's just the collected hours of millions of people who are denied basic human rights  
for the privilege of not starving and freezing to death,  
and it will never see the light of day without significant intervention.

That's really the difference between rich and wealthy.  
Don't get me wrong,  
The Rich should probably not have everything they have either,  
but focusing on The Rich is just targeting the cannon fodder.  

it's the workers who make the bosses Wealthy,  
the Wealthy who makes some workers Rich,  
and the rest are made Poor.

Now, that doesn't make sense, does it?  
if the Wealthy wanted, they could make us all comfortable,  
but then we wouldn't need them, and that's not something they want to happen.  
I would like to make these Wealthy souls comfortable,  
these Rich souls comfortable,  
and most of all these Poor souls finally comfortable.  

That's what equality is.  
it's not "take everything from everyone wealthy and rich so they all die in a ditch,"  
it's "make sure everyone can do the work they want to do without undue burden."
that's no fever dream,  
it's literally what Google claims keeps their team creative,  
and them very very wealthy.
it's just a fever dream if you don't happen to work  
for a company that puts forward any semblance of give-a-fuck to their workers,  
so we should do what we can to change that fever dream into a hot and spicy reality wherever possible.

This topic is really important to me because the inequality of wealth is only part of the problem.   
the problem is the system beneath,  
but we can at least TRY to equalize comfort at the expense of like,

Oh, fun fact for the end of 2019, the federal reserve doled out [400 billion dollars to the repo market,][09] (09)    
Repo here doesn't mean reposessed, it means repurchasing agreement.  
it's short-term bonds supported by the government.
Like the...  
housing / bank crisis.
400 billion dollars is enough to buy a fully self-driving,  
top tier tesla cybertruck for the entire populations of nevada and new mexico combined.  
...  
You may now breathe out.
