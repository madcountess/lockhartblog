So, I think it's time to talk about this election.  
I've avoided doing so because it's been a frankly depressing topic since the pandemic hit.  
This is definitely going to be the most controversial video on my channel, so strap in:

Who am I gonna vote for?

I've been thinking about this more and more recently,  
because it's very clear by the topics covered on this channel,  
which direction I SHOULD be leaning by all external standards,  
and it may benefit people to understand why it's such a conflicted topic.  
Personally, I'm apolitical.  
I've got no dog in this race,  
so I have to think about it with a certain detachment a lot of folks  
who have strong opinions about elections can find tough to conceive of.  
There's this very absolutist attitude I've seen going around that  
"If you don't vote for Trump, you're voting for Biden!" and  
"if you don't vote for Biden, you're voting for Trump!"  
which is just absolute emotional manipulation,  
and to many of those conflicted, emotional abuse.  
But that's beside the point, why are people conflicted in the first place?  
It seems so black-and-white, where's... the grey?  
If you can't choose one over the other, you're just letting the other guy win, right?  
RIGHT!?  
no.  
that's not the point of conflict.  
the point of conflict doesn't come on election day or inauguration day,  
the point of conflict is now and continues forever.  
We've already talked about the Holistic view of history and how chunks of time are  
imaginary,  
illusory,  
informational sure,  
but descriptive?  
I don't quite think so.  
Time is not a dimension we have free travel through,  
we have to keep moving in one direction whether or not we like it.  
Trying to grapple with history on a 4 year cycle is like trying to build a castle from dry sand and a plastic bucket.  
You're not gonna get anywhere,  
and most of the time you're gonna be standing still screaming at the sand  
as it continues to evade your grasp.  
You're just not gonna build anything that lasts with elections.  
What do I mean?  

### Electoralism

Basically, electoralism sucks, and it hasn't been working for a lot of people for a long time.  
We re-elected Bill Clinton for "The Economy, Stupid," we re-elected Bush for "The War, Stupid"  
That Economy was just deregulation of banks further than Reagan did.  
How's that going?  

[(Housing Bubble Pop)][01] (01)  

Hmm.  
That war tried to build a new Iraq.  
How's that doing?  
(ISIS Flag)  
Oh. Right.  
Well, those are abstract ideas anyway.  
We elected Obama with the promise of a public option,  
we elected Trump with the promise of a wall.  
How did that Public Option do?  
[(Obama Concedes Public Option)][02] (02)  
Eh that was probably a bad idea anyway.  
What about That Wall?  
(still no wall)  
... probably also a bad idea.  
Well, I mean, we elected... Abraham Lincoln right?  
How's his republican party doin' about that slavery thing?  
[(Prison Farms)][03] (03)
OH.  
UH.  
DEMOCRATS?  
WAI-  
[(Kamala Harris "prosecuted truancy" clip)][04] (04)  
UHHHH.  
UH.  
UM...  
Well...  
shoot.  
I must be cherry picking here,  
but I am having trouble thinking of other political events that went particularly well.  
We have gay marriage, though that's in danger,  
and some rights for trans people are in danger,  
not to mention Abortion,  
the supreme court right?  
We can't change the supreme court,  
it's fundamentally compromised for a generation.  
Executive Orders won't work,  
those generally expire with the presidency.  
How about Police Brutality,  
that's going to be worse right?  
Possibly, sure,  

[but as put by Cornell West:][08] (08)  
"We had a black president, a black secretary of state,  
and a black attorney general and they STILL couldn't deliver"  

BLM started under Obama,  
who approved the XL Pipeline over the objections of native sovreign nations,  
just like every president does in one way or another.  
Also, Joe spoke on the floor of congress in favor of increased policing as well as cuts  
to medicare and social security over increases of taxation of the ridiculously wealthy business owners,  
and even confirmed that on TV.
[(Biden for Cuts to SSA & Medicare)][05] (05)  
Trump's still worse, right?  
Arguably?  
COVID?  
[(Clip of Biden opposing medicare4all)][06] (06)  

**facepalm

the lesser of two evils isn't better than the other anyway,  
it just leads to voter apathy and decreased turnout.  
I'd like one, ONE good reason to vote for Joe Biden, PLEASE.  
"He's not openly a fascist?"  
openly?  
"not a fascist?"  
are you sure?  
What does he say about anti-fascists?  
[(Joe Biden: I denounce anti-fascist action, and violence in any form!)][07] (07)  
Yeah, thought so.  
"well he chose a woman of color for vice president, right?"  
as a token move, sure, he kinda broadcast that fact to the world ahead of time.  
"postal service?"  
I can't find anyone asking him about it directly, so hypothetically sure.  
I mean the Postal Worker union endorses him, and he's said that Trump's gutting of the postal service is  
"because he doesn't want an election."  
would you risk COVID to vote for the postal service?  
I don't know if I could bring myself to, and that's the point.  
Any positive Biden may have isn't outweighed by the negatives,  
but the positives certainly don't make up for the negatives.  
"okay smartass, what do you propose?"  
What do I propose?  

### Direct Action

We're still trying to organize something like a general strike to make demands of the government directly,  
it's been shown to work in other unions,  
so I don't see any reason the United States should be any different.  
We've seen success with the Pilot's Unions refusing to cater to businesses,  
and the government usually bends over backwards to make that economic engine run again.  
We can also work on local programs to provide for people directly without  
going through a tax structure that is raising taxes on us workers while cutting taxes on business owners.  
There are food bank ideas, home and community gardening ideas,  
a movement of people taking owned but unused land from the people who are having their taxes cut  
so the houses and land can be used to house and feed us without reliance on  
fickle, insecure, and unreliable markets.
We've got people out in the streets protesting the IDEA of police on a daily basis,  
so it's pretty clear that policing's gotta go, in favor of community defense.  
We have lots of people who believe in individual ownership of guns etc,  
but not much organization on what that means for us, that can be fixed.  
Local ballot measures, a form of direct democracy,  
are already pretty well enshrined in law in many places,  
that can be used to help us transform this hellhole into a place where people can actually live.  
There are plans by many different organizations to have sustainable energy in both production and usage,  
especially when it comes to efficiency of electricity usage.  
If we actually put 80% of the energy we put into elections that happen all at once every year  
into the things that matter all the time,  
I'm almost entirely certain that these forms of self-organization and direct action  
will do more to help us than the dearth of help we've gotten  
from the top down organization and indirect action in pollbooths.  
It's not easy,  
it's hard work,  
but we're hard working Americans and that's just something we do, right?  
I myself am a teacher,  
it's about all this broken body can do,  
but that's fine because we need education just as much as we need  
strong backs, arms, and legs, to build up a real actual society of people,  
rather than a society of "people" aka corporations being given more human rights than humans are given.  
Biden and Trump aren't going to be in favor of any of that,  
I guarantee it,  
so we're gonna have to fight against their efforts either way.  

I can't just link to organizations that are doing this work right now,  
because I simply do not have the time to gather the names and contact information  
of every locality's organizational efforts,  
plus I seriously do not have the time to vet all of those organizations.  
The best thing to do is talk to your neighbors and community members,  
~~one of the best places to do that is nextdoor,~~  
at least during "these trying times" as door-to-door organizing seems inadvisable during an airborne pandemic,  
where you can talk to your neighbors about what they believe to be wrong with your local area,  
and you can propose solutions to those things from the list I just said out loud.  
(NOTE: Nextdoor is completely useless, a lost cause. I hope we can speak to our neighbors more directly soon. ðŸ’•)

It may be difficult, because people are stubborn, but don't get mad at them.  
Be mad WITH them.  
Make that connection.  
I can't tell you what the best thing is for any individual locality,  
that's not really my purpose,  
but I can tell you the general ideas you can use when talking to people in your life  
about what needs to be done to change the world.  
It's hard to do studies on this, because there are too many variables to nail down,  
but I believe in your ability to communicate with your neighbors and communities  
about what we can do to fix their problems.  

If Trump wins, we get more of what's going on right now, more often,  
and with more open violence.  
If Biden wins, we get more of what's going on right now, about as or less often,  
and with more hidden violence.  
The problem is that this election is a grain in the bucket,  
and we still have no way to build a castle with these dry grains of sand.  
I think you should still vote.  
Clearly there are ballot measures and local elections that will have  
a greater impact on your life than the presidential one,  
and frankly I don't have to justify myself when I tell you who I'm voting for  
because I think you already know.  
I've got my absentee ballot in the mail,  
so I'll fill that out when it gets here.  
So, am I gonna vote for Trump or for Biden?  
Well, I think I'm gonna go with-
