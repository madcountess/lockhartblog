headline: Why Do We Buy Experiences?
summary: Buy Experiences! Not Things! Carpe Diem! It's really interesting how insidious this very relatable idea is, and what implications it has in its commonplace, near quotidian state.

"Don't spend your money on things, spend it on experiences! Live a little!"  
it's a saying I think we've all heard from some rebellious maverick on youtube,  
probably with a red shirt?  
Anyway, I've recently been thinking about it because I'm understanding more and more  
WHY I agree with this unexpectedly insidious sentiment.  

it's incontrovertable that your experiences live and die with you,  
but your things can only really represent you in a pretty extreme abstract.  
photos may last a long time,  
they might survive in a museum if you're particularly artistic about them,  
and you can capture a mood,  
a moment,  
an atmosphere,  
and that atmosphere can linger past your death,  
unlike the experiences you paid to have.  

but the thing about photos is that they only show snapshots,  
if we go to video, it's always a clip or a stream or something else constructed by a lens,  
either material or metaphorical  
the memories you have are much more dynamic,  
they change,  
they fade,  
they disappear,  
and they die with you...  

but they also feel more real because it's simply not possible to capture the lucid haze  
that makes a memory feel warm and fuzzy in a way that an object never will.  
so why do we end up spending so much of our money on things,  
and why do we focus so much on changing that financial choice to experiences?  

perhaps you've never thought of memories that way, perhaps you think that I'm overly sentimental or  
I haven't considered that some day it might be possible to capture all of that sensory data and emulate...  
just...

I get it, okay, you've watched minority report.

perhaps you think that these photos and videos and memorabilia ARE enough to keep a memory alive,  
keep a solid connection to the qualia of life
that's fine, I certainly love recorded media a lot myself  
clearly  
but I have a feeling you don't also think that a really fancy watch you bought for yourself  
because you wanted a fancy watch is going to replace those experiences  
but why do we care?  
why do we desire for amazing life experiences?  
why do we think we can have more of them for money?  
and why don't we already do that more?  
I think,  
in large part,  
we understand that we have given our lives,  
in large part,  
to the places in which we toil to survive,  
in large part.  
we understand,  
in small part  
that we've been robbed,  
in small part  
and we'd like to take that back,  
in small part  
it's not complete,  
it's not properly human to give up so much of ourselves,  
that we must take the money we make to survive and spend it on "living a little."  
I always found that expression kinda fatalist, defeatist, lacking in critical thought, and stunning in context  
this is not something we should accept or expect,  
and it's not something we should only question in passing or secret.  

the cat's out of the bag  
and it was put there by god-kings, empresses, countesses, and feudal lords,  
before the advent of the taskmaster, the CEO, and the board of investors  
a tax on the meager fraction of the value we add for the investors is taken from us,  
unlike the investors, who seem to get paid from our taxes  
do you know what we used to call someone like that?  
we called them lords, we called them countesses and barrons,  
we called them kings and queens, we used to call them emperors, god queens of the almighty sun  
and now we call them boss.  
we call them jerks behind their backs.  
we call their offices when we get fired.  
and we call the hotlines when we don't think we have it in us to "live a little"  

work harder,  
they say  
you'll retire one day,  
they say  
you'll have your 401k,  
they say  
as long as you just keep on giving away what has already been pilfered and pillaged by the proper,  
the priviliged, the petty punk pushing you past your point...  

and you break  

but don't worry,  
they said  
you have vacation days,  
they said  
it's not like you can get pregnant,  
they said  
but if you could,  
you would be out of luck,  
up your own creek without a puddle from which to drink  
as your vacation days become your sick days become your unpaid days become your unemployed days...  

and you break.   

you have your rainy day fund,  
they might say  
you can spend it on a new tv,  
they might say  
or you could spend it on experiences,  
they will say  
until your rainy days come,  
and take it all away,  
leaving you empty without a stray experience to help you "live a little..."  

and you break.

so take stock of the life you currently have,  
and the life you have lived so far,  
and hope your future experiences are worth the life being stolen from you in the present,  
and the life stolen from you so far,  
and the life you will eventually lose altogether,  
be it given or stolen in its last moments,  
and just try to live a little.
even if,  
maybe especially if,  
it's hard to fathom from the void of isolation separating us from each-other.
