### Part 1: Are You Stupid?  
One of the problems I see in rhetoric by our media is the essentialist view of intelligence  
espoused by so called "intellectuals" that Conservatives Are Dumb, End Of Story  
I... don't buy it.  
I've actually read a significant number of articles I find to be abhorrent,  
and time after time, it wasn't stupidity that gave me pause between lines,  
but the malicious intent hidden beneath the cellophane tape of deniable language.  
If you think you can make something like that while remaining  
*ahem*  
"Stupid"  
then I think you might be writing off people who CAN gain support and influence as uninfluential,  
and I believe that to be a short-sighted act.  
Even the most conservative republicans in congress understand that  
"protect the healthcare of people with pre-existing conditions"  
is a good enough talking point that they will steal it from democrats to use as a hollow expression during elections.  
They know it sounds good,  
They're just against it.  
That's not stupidity,  
That's ideology.  
Let's start out with a couple definitions, stupid and smart.  
Stupid: from Latin "stupere" meaning "be amazed or stunned"  
and coming to mean "willfully ignorant" or "severely lacking in intelligence or common sense"  
Simple enough  
Smart: of Germanic origin, meaning "Having or Showing quick-witted Intelligence" in modern parlance.  
even simpler!

[J:st Like: The Whole Video cut it up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAfwumFZdbs)  

it's upsetting how frequently both liberals and conservatives use intelligence as an insult  
simply because they disagree on principles, though they agree on system.  
it's also upsetting to see this argument coming from some leftists,  
and while I don't blame you for the culture in which you're raised,  
it would be best to go forward without this colloquy and framing.  
First thing's first, people aren't "stupid" based on ideology.  
on the other hand, one is not simply unintelligent.  
and C: having a different flavor and direction of intelligence doesn't make you a bad person.  
finally: denigrating the perceived lack of intellect and "common-sense" a person might have is really not super okay.  

I feel I must make a distinction here:  
it is possible to know more or less than someone about a subject,  
and it is possible for someone to be incurious about certain subjects,  
but one cannot be universally incurious,  
and facts are no substitute for the capacity for logic and reasoning.

now, ask yourself: why might people be particularly resentful of science  
when they're constantly being told how stupid they are  
for not trusting the people calling them stupid?  
hmm.  
we may never know.  
regardless, it's important not to stoop to this intellectual bigotry,  
because it is a form of bigotry,  
and pre-judges someone's place on an arbitrary hierarchy that marginalizes all sorts of people.  
Which brings me to this article in The Atlantic about the disadvantages of ... being stupid? what?  

["the war on stupid people"][01] (01)  
okay yeah sure, that's muuuuch better.  
"As recently as the 1950s,  
possessing only middling intelligence was not likely to severely limit your life’s trajectory.  
IQ wasn’t a big factor in whom you married,  
where you lived,  
or what others thought of you."

IQ is bullshit, let's skip this part.
gotta be a study here somewhere, ah!

"This gleeful derision seems especially cruel in view of the more serious abuse  
that modern life has heaped upon the less intellectually gifted.  
Few will be surprised to hear that,  
according to the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,  
a long-running federal study,  
IQ correlates with chances of landing a financially rewarding job.  
Other analyses suggest that each IQ point is worth hundreds of dollars in annual income—  
surely a painful formula for the 80 million Americans with an IQ of 90 or below.  
When the less smart are identified by lack of educational achievement  
(which in contemporary America is closely correlated with lower IQ),  
the contrast only sharpens."

IQ is bullshit, let's skip this part

"CEB, one of the world’s largest providers of hiring assessments,  
evaluates more than 40 million job applicants each year.  
The number of new hires who report having been tested nearly doubled from 2008 to 2013, says CEB.  
To be sure, many of these tests scrutinize personality and skills,  
rather than intelligence.  
But intelligence and cognitive-skills tests are popular and growing more so.  
In addition, many employers now ask applicants for SAT scores  
(whose correlation with IQ is well established);  
some companies screen out those whose scores don’t fall in the top 5 percent."

I'm going to scream.  
the points here aren't exactly wrong,  
but they are framing this entirely wrong.  
Of COURSE IQ shouldn't be used to determine someone's worth,  
because it shouldn't be used!  
at all!  
are you fuckin' st- ahhh uh, I meant ah uh *ahem*  
this article is based on assumptions that do not hold up to scrutiny and are based in a eugenic framework,  
marring the facts and distancing itself from the casual intellectual bigotry it itself is trying to advocate against.  
that's right.  
it's time to talk about eugenics suddenly!

### Part 2: Insidious Quiz?  
IQ is determined by a few standardized tests,  
though, according to research done by Haier,  
it appears that IQ has little to no correlation with someone's abstractly defined intelligence.  
["The Neuroscience of Intelligence" (a textbook)][03] (03)  
was brutal in how hard it debunks the accuracy of a nebulously defined "intelligence"  
as nothing more than a purity test.  
Originally, they were basically the Pearson tests for kids in Paris.  
Yes.  
Kids.
When it was ported to the US culture,  
it was wrapped with an extra few layers of rich white man for good measure.  
If, for instance,  
you study for the test,  
you will get a higher IQ score,  
because it's a standardized test.
You can study.  
To raise your IQ.  
That should be it, to be honest.  
That should be the nail in the coffin.  
Yet, it ALSO appears to have quite a fanbase,  
a large group of people who believe in the concept of IQ as an empirical measure of smartness,  
who would say that it was an anomaly or perhaps within standard deviation...  
so I guess we have to talk about the ideology of IQ Realism.

Many ideologues of this group are proponents of,  
and usually members of,  
"High IQ Societies" like Mensa,  
for which one's eligibility is based on their score on IQ tests,  
and approved alternatives which are approved [on how well they correlate to IQ test results.][04] (04)  
Tests are chosen on their results in comparison to the results of a well-debunked test,  
and these tests are used as alternatives to the IQ test to maintain legitimacy.  
If you are like me, you might recognize a bit of a problematic pattern there.  

And when it comes to problematic patterns,  
one need look no further than Charles Murray.  
Charles Murray, SPLC entry-haver, co-author of The Bell Curve,  
a book's title which comes from the bell-shaped normal distribution of (IQ),  
cited, in his work defending IQ, a lot of research funded by The Pioneer Fund,  
a non-profit organization with it's own SEPARATE SPLC entry.  
And this mmm "Fund" is not just abstractly kinda racist,  
you see,  
the very first president of this "fund,"  
Harry Laughlin quote "received an honorary degree from the Nazi-controlled University of Heidelberg  
as "a pioneer in the science of race cleansing,"  
only three months before the Pioneer Fund was incorporated.  
Yeah, and that's just ONE of the guys involved in the founding of this fund,  
and all of them are pretty nazi-sympathetic and lauded by literal nazis.  
They've had to couch their language and change tact in recent years,  
but don't be fooled by rebranding.  
The Bell Curve, filled with research funded by the Pioneer... Fund,  
argues for an end to welfare because welfare encourages the poors to make more babies,  
which will lead to the collapse of civilization because if we have too many low IQ individuals,  
they'll outbreed the high IQ individuals and nobody will run society!  
And you know what?  
[Bill Clinton bought it][02] (02)  
"You're too stupid, so you don't get to eat food have fun dying in the streets loser!"  
Thanks.  
Bill.  
Y'rapist.  
I mean racist.  
well...  
Anyway, Stephen Hawking once said when he was asked about his IQ:  
“I have no idea. People who boast about their I.Q. are losers.”  
So let's move on from these... losers.  
It's understandable to feel patronized.  
The concept of the toxic intellectual has arisen as a result of this assumption that some people are just stupid,  
and therefore not worthy of respect or life.  
though, we have to make sure we don't indulge that anger too much.

### Part 3: Fuck These Eggheads, Right?  
So, half of this is the people who idolize intelligence,  
and the other half is people who demonize it.
and that brings us to anti-intellectualism,  
which I think does need a clear definition before going forward

anti-intellectualism: an ideological or purely personal aversion or hostility towards academic  
[{Fox Host: College is Indoctrination}](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6073093204001/)

artistic  
[{Lara Loomer interrupts Comedic Play}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJYR3wa2984)

social  
[{Fox Hosts complain about Genderbread People}](https://twitter.com/peltzmadeline/status/1075206666965139456)

and other theories proposed by intellectuals  
[{Tucker Carlson: Columbus Good, Immigrants Bad}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bH3-sJ4fLI)

preferring emotion  
[{Alex Jones: HILLARY CLINTON IS A DEMON}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivJGmyNlQuU)

and action  
[{Rightist Protesters: "Jews. Will Not. Replace Us."}][05] (05-video)

as the solution to problems for the common man  

To be fair, action isn't all bad,  
it just depends on your practical application of theory,  
and emotion is important to just about everyone but the cold calculating scientists in Stranger Things.  
So anti-intellectualism isn't always wrong.  
I'm not saying it's particularly valid as an ideology,  
but it is rational to spring up in societies that so exacerbate class differences  
into how valid your type of intelligence is to said society.  
Or, in short, it depends on the society to determine whether or not you are considered stu-  
uh, unintelligent,  
it is not an essential property,  
it's a prescribed social construct.  
This base concept, this essentialism,  
has proven repeatedly throughout history to be nothing but a smokescreen.  
It's the baseline excuse for bigotry.  
You are intelligent.  
I don't think you need me to tell you that,  
but I think it bears saying,  
because so much of our media is intent on driving wedges between us for ratings and ideological cultivation.  
There is nothing about you or me that makes you or I a bad person on an essential level.  
If you support genocide,  
you support genocide,  
but it's not because you are german by heritage,  
it's because you got kicked out of art school for being bad at art,  
so pretending like all Germans are genocidal authoritarians is actually pretty fucked up.  

The same thing happens all the time here:  
conservatives are stupid,  
liberals are weak,  
and leftists are... Jewish... puppeteers...?  
these are all essentialist points, and they don't help.  
the only result of making these points is driving people away.  
so instead, try to be inclusive,  
criticize words and actions, rather than just body and mind.
