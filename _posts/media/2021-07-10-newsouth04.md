Ahoy hoy, I'm Luna, the People's Bayonet!  
That's peoplesbayo.net!  
Comin' at you as-live from occupied Georgia!  
My friends, my family, my fellow new southerners.  
We find our circumstances dire,  
without water, food, or fire,  
all that we have left is shelter from the coming storm...  

The Coup, The Insurrection, The Capitol Riots, on January sixth. You'll see me refer to it as 1/6. I've heard the news call it a power grab attempt by then sitting president Donald Trump, and perhaps it was, perhaps it wasn't, It really doesn't matter, materially, because it's been used to justify some heinous opportunism. This follows on from my previous video on Reform and Retribution. Watch that other one if you feel like you got lost or somethin', but I hope to keep things all simple-like for ya.

I've seen some opinions that I'm turning to the dark side in 2021, which, I dunno. is the "dark side" here class unity against the fucking capitalists or am I missing something? I swear, as soon as I spoke out about how people shouldn't be turning in their fucking friends, family, neighbors, or hell, enemies to the fucking FBI: they're like "but they have to be punished!" WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU TALK ING TO I have a whole video about how we can't just punish people, it doesn't help. like,  
\*checks notes*
let's see,
\*ruffles notes*
which of these came first... ah.  
okay, so, let's start in November. Donald Trump versus Joe Biden, the heavyweight match of the century, all out, knock out, bloodsport. Texas goes Red.  

so, here's the thing:  
whether or not there was manipulation of votes by democrats, it doesn't matter, [because it was happening on the republican side at very least.][01] (01)  
this makes any "election stealing" narrative fucking absurd. that being said, so that we have a baseline of where I'm coming at this from, we should talk about the people involved in this story.  

we have Donald Trump, we have Joseph Biggs, and we have the FBI. Joseph Biggs, for his part, [was a regular informant to the FBI about the Proud Boys' plans and activities,][02] (02)    
and also a leader of the Proud Boys, so that's interesting.  

I can't pretend that there's clear intent by the FBI in ignoring this stuff, perhaps they weren't aware because it was chaotic, barely planned, and oh wait.  

[there were over 50 alerts and warnings sent to the FBI by conservative platform Parler about January 6th][03] (03)
they knew, a lot of people knew, and then what happened?

[Former President Donald Trump gave a speech,][04] (04)    
which you can argue over whether or not it's inciting the capitol riots, that's not really important, the point is that the Proud Boys took it to mean "storm the capitol" and then they stormed the capitol.

so, we now have, as a part of our domestic terrorism law, ["anarchist violent extremists , who violently oppose all forms of capitalism, corporate globalization , and governing institutions ,which they perceive as harmful to society;"][05] (05)  

we can just say that that is a catch-all, and that we've had this in the past, but I guarantee this is greatly in response to the protests last year. can I prove it? I'm not sure I could prove that. but from a holistic standpoint, the material effect is that we went from police protests, to insurrectionist riot lead by an informant at the request of the president, to anti-terror law that classifies all direct action against capitalism to be possible terrorism. you have to remember that "violence" includes property damage, legally speaking.

for example: 3 people in Salt Lake City splashed red paint on the District Attourney's building,  
you know, because subtlety is just dead I guess, and as a result of this not being 1 or 2 people, but 3 or more (specifically 3) this protest against the state was deemed to be gang activity and got the perpetrators [threatened with life sentences][06] (06)  
for a protest.  
like, it's literally paint.  
It's.  
Literally.  
Paint.

not to mention the US Marshals last year killing an anti-fascist activist, [and the president bragged about it?][07] (07)  

but hey, that was under the fascist right? oh oops nevermind, [the marshals killed another anti-fascist activist,][08] (08)  

weird. It's almost like these guys aren't on our side! \*Gasp!*  

I'm still upset with the people who were telling me to support the FBI after the capitol riots on 1/6. The ones lead by an FBI informant? As a result of these riots, which the FBI certainly knew about, and the DHS would've been aware, [the FBI, CIA, and DHS are taking more action in surveillance of "extremist chatter"][09] (09)    
and "suspected domestic terrorists" these terms are wildly vague, and if Navy Training Manuals can be believed, the US Military specifically teaches that: ["Anarchists, Socialists, and Neo-Nazis" are "Political Terrorists."][09a] (09a)

it doesn't matter who any of those rioters or politicians or organizations are, or why they did anything they did, we now have that anti-terror law and heightened surveillance. that's not something we should really be okay with. I'm not saying the FBI lead the riots, we will assume they were organic. What this does show; however, is that attempts by the FBI to prevent the riots were insufficient. Capitol Police underprepared because the threat was not prioritized, [unlike when peaceful anti-police protests happened, weirdly,][09b] (09b)  
It also shows that they had a list of names for some people involved in the riots, and at least 50 warnings from Parler about the riots beforehand, but these opportunists wanted to take this opportunity to try to get the FBI on our side. ... the ... side of ... revolution? That doesn't seem sensible.
ah yes, the agency tasked with  
\*checks notes*  
protecting power will definitely be  
\*checks notes again*  
against capitalism if we just turn in our friends and family!  
they already had most of the names, they were gonna get their marks, that was never a problem. I think there's an attempt by many people in the media to push the narrative that we need to give more power to the current state because otherwise the republicans will win, and then the republicans win, and they have even more concentrated power. fucking merry-go-round shit.

the problem when dealing with systems is that it can be easy to come off like a conspiracy theorist. but the problem isn't that it's a conspiracy, the problem is that it doesn't need to be a conspiracy. there are perverse incentives in place because of our economic, social, and political systems. there's no reason not to exploit those perverse incentives, so, the people who end up with power are the ones who tend to do so. we're predisposed by our socialization, our maturation, our propagandization even, to trend towards exploiting these incentives. ..it's not something anybody needs to be specifically in control for, the system isn't broken, it's working perfectly, all those cliches. they're only cliches because they're real, and it feels helpless to fight against the systems because of the feeble strength of one. but that's the point. if we do not build class solidarity, if we do not reject the rule of the current powers-that-be, if we continue to think of ourselves as individuals, separate from each other, instead of the eusocial superorganism known as humanity, and specifically the working class, we will not succeed in replacing the systems in place.  
and as I said with my last video, we can't just replace the people in power, we have to replace the systems too, we have to replace the toolsets. those who call for unity against the state tend to be the ones who get rubbed out for their terroristic ways, either by the state itself, or by sympathizers with their own ulterior motives...  

[Biden's Justice Department intends to defend Trump, by the way.][12] (12)  
Boy, that sure keeps happening, doesn't it. I just don't understand how we can get here from "We need you to report everyone involved to the FBI, [because Trump incited this riot"][13] (13)  

last november, the day before the election, I said:

"
If Trump wins, we get more of what's going on right now, more often, and with more open violence. If Biden wins, we get more of what's going on right now, about as or less often, and with more hidden violence.  
"

well, call me cassanda I guess. this system does not want us around, it thinks of us as a threat, and its agents are more than willing to oblige. so for that feeble strength of one, we have to be organized and unite. these petty squabbles over differences in religion, affiliation, identity, whatever, it's all just distractions. bigotry is a fucking distraction, sectarianism is a fucking distraction, just like, stop the crap. real, true, working unity has to be achieved. some of us will perish, but they need us, and therein lies our power, so long as we stick together.

we have a choice: we can either stick together, or we can perish. feel free to argue against that all you want, but without unity, we will fail.  

to paraphrase one of my biggest inspirations:

If the owning class don’t want us against them, let them divest. No matter who we are, we must learn to forget our differences. If we have them, let us differ in the closet; when we come out in front, let us not have anything to argue about until we get finished with the owners.  

If the late President Kennedy could get together with Khrushchev and exchange some wheat, we certainly have more in common with each other than Kennedy and Khrushchev had with each other. If we don’t do something real soon, I think you’ll have to agree, that we’re going to be forced either to use the ballot or the bullet. It’s one or the other. It isn’t that time is running out – time has run out! Every year politicians will be in the so-called Minority Communities jiving you and me for some votes. Every year the political crooks will be right back in your and my community with their false promises, building up our hopes for a letdown, with their trickery and their treachery, with their false promises which they don’t intend to keep. As they nourish these dissatisfactions, it can only lead to one thing, an explosion; and now we have the type of person who just doesn’t intend to turn the other cheek any longer.  

Rest in Power, brother Malcolm. assassinated February 21st 1965 by this government.

"
On February 21st 2021, following the passing of black former New York City police officer Raymond A Wood (Ray), his confession of “actions that, in hindsight, were deplorable and detrimental to the advancement of his own black people” between 1964 and 1971 made in 2011 was unsealed.  
Worrying that his death would remove justice for Thomas Johnson, who was wrongly convicted of assassinating Malcom X, he wrote a confession to be released upon his death.  

The Facts are as follows.  

April 17, 1964, Ray was hired by the New York City police department. Without training, he was immediately assigned to the BOSSI (Bureau of Special Services and Investigation) unit. His job was to infiltrate civil rights organizations throughout New York City, to find evidence of criminal activity, so the FBI could discredit and arrest its leaders.  

After witnessing repeated brutality at the hands of his coworkers (Police), he tried to resign. Instead he was threatened with arrest by pinning marijuana and alcohol trafficking charges on him if he did not follow through with the assignments.  

Under the direction of his handlers, he was told to encourage leaders and members of civil rights groups to commit felonious acts.  

The Statue of Liberty bombing idea was created by his supervisor/handler. Using surveillance, the agency learned that Bowe and Sayyed were key players in Malcom X’s crowd control security detail. It was Ray’s assignment to draw the two men into a felonious federal crime, so that they could be arrested by the FBI and kept away from managing Malcom X’s Audubon Ballroom door security on February 21st, 1965. On February 16th, 1965, The Statue of Liberty plot was carried out and the men were arrested just days before the assassination of Malcom. At the time, Ray was not aware that Malcom X was the target.  

On February 21st, 1965, Ray was ordered to be at the Audubon Ballroom, where he was identified by witnesses while leaving the scene. Thomas Johnson was later arrested and wrongfully convicted to protect his cover and the secrets of the FBI and NYPD.  

[Ray placed his full confession into the care of his cousin, Reginald Wood Jr.,][10] (10)  
[and requested the information be held until his passing.][11] (11)  
"

This is kinda the danger of playing pattycakes with the FBI.  

I don't care who it is you're informing about, if you talk to the FBI, you're snitching. We don't want no snitching. The FBI ain't never gonna be on our side, we have to replace the current state with something that will always be on our side.  

Go to People's Bayonet, that's PeoplesBayo.Net,  
for sources and transcript, as well as ways to fund this operation.  
To a working unity, my friends.  
Solidarity forever. ✊
