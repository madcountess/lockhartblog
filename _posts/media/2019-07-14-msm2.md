(CA: discussion of extreme violence)

Ahoy hoy, I'm Luna, and I don't want to get political here, but...  
I have been seeing some complaints about political violence recently, and I have to say it's quite disturbing!  
I can't even remember the first attack, but I definitely remember one of the more recent ones in the UK  
That politician didn't even know what hit them  
A brutal attack on democracy by an extremist of the most vile nature  

[Nigel Farage gets Milkshaked][01] (01 - Video)  

uh...  
wait what?

##	Milkshakes  

[News Clip: Labor MP Shot Dead][02] (02)  
"there's hell on, there's chaos, he's stabbed people and shot people"  
"the police found a large collection of nazi memorabilia and books at [his] home,  
they also found a dossier on Cox and evidence of internet searches for extreme right wing material"  
"my name is death to traitors freedom for brittain"

**stunned silence with "milkshake" in hand  
**slowly droop head, put "milkshake" down  
uh, um... ha ha?  
freedom?  
for brittain?  

Pardon my country's current imperialism, but HA! Good... one...  
...  
That's actually kinda sickening and depressing and hard to talk about...  

**deep breath  
what was this about a milkshake again?  

[Nigel Farage Hides in Campaign Bus][03] (03)  
"Nigel Farage has been forced to seek refuge on his campaign bus  
after being stalked by people carrying milkshakes in Kent, according to reports.  
The Brexit party leader and his campaign team seemed keen to avoid a repeat of events in Newcastle on Monday,  
when he was doused in banana and salted caramel milkshake after making a speech."

Banana and salted caramel?  
good combo!

"Following a tour of Dartford and Gravesend before Thursday’s EU elections,  
things took an unfortunate turn for Farage in Rochester,  
where three young men wearing balaclavas with their hoods up were spotted by a supporter.  
He was then told to stay on the bus"

**sigh
I mean, in the end, this is just more people getting dunked with milkshakes,  
I am trying to talk about political violence here.  
What was that thing the president was talking about a couple years back?  
Charlottesville?  
There were bad people on... both sides, I think?  

[Fascists Chanting "JEWS! WILL NOT! REPLACE US!"][04] (04)

B... both? Sides?

[Fascist #1 Crashes Car Through People][05] (05)  
[Fascist #1's Motivations][06]  
"some associates are starting to paint a disturbing picture.  
'I hate to say it, I wasn't that surprised'  
one of his high-school teachers says he idolized dictator and mass murderer, Adolph Hitler.  
former classmates telling a similar story, saying during an overseas trip to germany,  
he allegedly told students while walking through a concentration camp 'this is where the magic happened.'"

I have GOT to talk to the editor about her video clip choices.  
hot damn.  
More nazis.  
Thanks.  
I hate it.  

[Carl Benjamin "She Died of a Heart Attack"][07] (07-Video)  
"just to jump in on the car thing,  
I thought heather hayes or heyer or whatever her name was,  
I thought she died of a heart attack"

a...heart attack?  
are you serious?  
someone needs to...  
[Carl Benjamin gets milkshaked][08] (08-Video)  
...yeah.

Where is this left wing violence, exactly?  
Something about Auntie Fuh?  
[Andy Ngo gets his ass beat][09] (09-Video)  
Oh that seems particularly violent!  
they must REALLY hate journalists!  
[Actually Andy Ngo is a Fascist Agitator who identified protesters to AtomWaffen, a terrorist militia][09]

...oh.  
Okay so I think the juxtaposition has been made quite clear,  
now let's talk about why you are only ever hearing complaints about the ... dairy dunks.  

## Clutched Pearls

[Let's start with an example of this asinine line of reasoning used by... let's call them "concerned citizens."][10]	(10)  
"First, it was eggs thrown at “right-wing” candidates.  
Then pies in the face.  
Now milkshakes.  
What if the next attack is a beaker full of acid?  
Will the far-left Twitter universe and American mainstream journalists laugh at that as well?"

first it was food, then it was food, but now it's food!  
what if someone uses a WEAPON!?  
yes... what if someone were to attack a politician with a weapon.

[That would be unthinkable. Wouldn't it?][02] (02-Video)

[Pearl Clutcher:][10] (10)  
"As we have seen here in the United States,  
it does not take much for unchallenged vile rhetoric  
to escalate into something much worse and much more dangerous.  
Where does the left draw the line on these threats?  
When do the liberal adults in the room say, “Enough is enough?""

The line I would draw is "killing people" and "actionable threats."  
If you want to know when the Liberal "adults" will say "enough is enough" I have some old news for you...  

[msm clips decrying protesters][11]

The status quo does not like protest, so the "liberal adults" have always said "enough is enough."  
I would ask why these people are extrapolating this hard, but let's be honest,  
It's because the people protesting are protesting against power structures.  
And it's kinda hard to maintain the current power structure when people no longer accept its legitimacy.  
Fascists don't question power.  
But let's humor this wrong person for a second.  

[Let's look at the facts on far-left violence][14a] (14a)  
"[Between 2007 and 2016], domestic extremists of all kinds [had] killed at least 372 people in  the United States.  
Of those deaths, approximately 74% were at the hands of right-wing extremists,  
about 24% of the victims were killed by domestic Islamic extremists,  
and the [2%] remainder were killed by left-wing extremists."

For context, this was published right before the Charlottesville riot,  
where leftist Heather Hayer was murdered by a Nazi who, let's remember, admired HITLER

["In 2018, domestic extremists killed at least 50 people in the U.S.,][14b] (14b)  
a sharp increase from the 37 extremist-related murders documented in 2017,  
though still lower than the totals for 2015 and 2016."

okay, so let's go over what they had to say about those years individually

["In 2015, the 52 deaths came at the hands of adherents of four domestic extremist movements:][14c] (14c)  
white supremacists, anti-government extremists, domestic Islamic extremists, and anti-abortion extremists"

50 plus 52, 102

["ADL’s preliminary tally of extremist-related murders for 2016 is already at 69,][14a]  
a figure that includes the 49 killed [at the Pulse Nightclub]  
as well as 20 other murders committed by white supremacists,  
anti-government extremists such as sovereign citizens, and black nationalists."

102 plus 69 (nice), 171

["By the preliminary tally of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism,][14d] (14d)  
34 people were killed by domestic extremists in 2017 [...]  
a majority of the 2017 murders were committed by right-wing extremists,  
primarily white supremacists, as has typically been the case most years."

171 plus 34, 205  
that's 205 over four years as opposed to 372 over the decade used to try to include some left-wing people,  
but let's check the most recent year

["2018 was a particularly active year for right-wing extremist murders:][14b] (14b)  
Every single extremist killing — from Pittsburgh to Parkland — had a link to right-wing extremism."

And that doesn't really support the narrative that the Left and AntiFA are  
somehow equivalent to legit fascists and nazis  
Being scary and intimidating, throwing milkshakes,  
and even roughing someone up with a couple cuts and bruises,  
is not the same thing as murder,  
and it's disingenuous to even pretend there's an equivalent threat.

## Don't Call it a Comeback  
Let's just take a moment here and take a deep breath.  

Let's get this out of the way right now.  
To say you will definitely be brutalized by fascists in the street would be disingenuous  
And to say that I'm comfortable with punching and kicking would be as well  
But this isn't new, it isn't foreign, and it does have institutional backing.  
We won't even focus on Nazis, because quite frankly,  
I don't actually WANT to put swastikas in my video?  
Let's keep it local, but we are going to go back to the same time period.

["After the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japanese aircraft on December 7, 1941,][15] (15)  
the U.S. War Department suspected that Japanese Americans might act as saboteurs or espionage agents,  
despite a lack of hard evidence to support that view.  
Some political leaders recommended rounding up Japanese Americans,  
particularly those living along the West Coast, and placing them in detention centers inland.  
Conditions at the camps were spare.  
Internees lived in uninsulated barracks furnished only with cots and coal-burning stoves.  
Residents used common bathroom and laundry facilities, but hot water was usually limited.  
The camps were surrounded by barbed-wire fences patrolled by armed guards who had instructions to shoot anyone who tried to leave."  

["People today tend to think of Nazi death camps as defining the term “concentration camp,” But before World War II,][16] (16)  
this phrase was used to describe the detention of civilians without trial based on group identity.  
As more unaccompanied minors and other asylum-seekers arrive on the southern border, alarming accounts continue:  
reports of rotten food causing illness, kennel-style fences holding migrants in El Paso, Texas,  
and another facility in the same city holding more than six times its capacity of detainees.  
This week, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would handle the influx  
of unaccompanied minors by housing some of them at Fort Sill, an Army base in Oklahoma  
that held detainees of Japanese descent during World War II.  
Today’s U.S.-Mexico border camps are the heirs of these concentration camps.  
Putting people in similar conditions will unleash illness and death.  
The more people who are detained, the larger these crises will become."

If you didn't notice, I started talking about the current day right there in the middle.  
It's almost hard to separate today from our history.  
"But Bay!  
Why are you talking about concentration camps?  
I thought this was about Fascists!"
Well, let's just check out if there's a connection between fascists and our concentration camps.

[Oh right.][17] (17)  
"A contractor for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is under investigation by his employer  
for posting bail in March to free a member of the right-wing men's fraternity  
the Proud Boys from the Multnomah County Jail.  
[The Contractor] has interacted with several self-identified members of the Proud Boys,  
as revealed in public records and social media posts
[His] Facebook page [had also] "liked" several pages linked to the far-right and anti-government groups  
like the "Oath Keepers" and the "Press Guard" Page,  
a "free speech" group connected to the pacific northwest chapter of the Three Percenters."

Oh god, Oath Keepers? Three Percenters? Proud Boys?  
What can I say but YIKES.  
Those 3 groups were present at the Charlottesville riot covered in body armor and packing heat...  
What was I talking about?  
Oh right, Milkshakes.  
Man, all this talk of dairy makes me want to go get a baked alaska to wash down with milk.  
Do we have any footage of that?

[Right-Wing Activist BakedAlaska screaming for milk][18] (18-Video)

I don't know what I expected.

## The Point  
I'm going to restate this: To suggest that you personally will get  
jailed, tortured, or killed by some fascist would be extremely presumptive.  
I don't know you, and you don't know me,  
so how could I possibly predict your future any more than you can predict mine?  
The point is that the media's framework is failing to keep us properly informed about the facts.  
We don't have to even look very hard to figure out that the narrative  
being pushed by mainstream outlets is horifficaly flawed.  
The frenzy over "left-wing violence" is not just dishonest, it's dangerous.  
It distracts from groups that are legitimately killing fucking civilians,  
and from the legit abuses of power by a government that has little to no respect for the humanity of the archetypal other.  
I hope this isn't a controversial statement, but like...  
Killing people is bad?  
Is that too extreme?  
Is it... radical to say "torture is bad?"  
Is it irrational to suggest that locking up nonviolent criminals in conditions mirroring those of  
the quite widely detested "internment" camps or other concentration camps throughout history is not good?  
I certainly don't think so; but, clearly that view is rejected by mass media...  
And our politicians...

[Nancy Pelosi on Anti-Fascist Action][19] (19)  
“Our democracy has no room for inciting violence or endangering the public,  
no matter the ideology of those who commit such acts.  
The violent actions of people calling themselves antifa  
in Berkeley this weekend deserve unequivocal condemnation,  
and the perpetrators should be arrested and prosecuted.”

The idea of respectability politics is exactly the kind of shit  
that lets us get trampled in the god damn streets by fascists  
while the people interested in protecting us get yelled at  
for throwing fucking milkshakes and property damage.  
Pelosi, delete your running form.  
Step down.  
Let us try to hold back the tide of blood that is to follow,  
[should fascism gain a tighter grip than it already has.][20] (20)  
Well, that's pretty much all I can handle for one video.  
I hope YOU have a nice day.
