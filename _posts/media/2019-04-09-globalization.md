(Content Advisory: Discussion of Suicide)

Ahoy hoy, I'm Luna.  
When we think of markets, we often think of products created in far off lands like  
Indy... India? or Chi-na? Never heard of 'em.  
What matters is that we here in the United States buy a lot of products from other countries  
to the point that "made in" completes to "made in china" before "made in america" damn. near. every. time.  
This global market is fueled by Globalization.  

-Globalization (n Economic Theory): The use of various nations' legal codes to cut costs wherever possible to maximize profit.

That seems pretty simple, what might be an argument for that?  

## A Case for Globalization

To start us out, let's look at the operation of a business under basic market theory:  

Raw materials, as well as the buildings and machines necessary for operation, are called Capital.  
The effort of using that Capital to make a Product is called Labor.  
The cost to store and ship the Product are also Labor, so we will keep this in mind.  
The cost of Capital plus the cost of Labor equals the value of the Product.  
So, how does someone make money by owning a business like this in a globalized market?  
Some use cheaper materials, as a result of a government subsidy in one part of the world,  
but that may lower quality.  
Some use a trade agreement between 2 countries to lower the shipping costs while maintaining quality.  
Some use the laws of one country to reduce the labor cost while maintaining  
a low cost on shipping and materials from the first 2 steps to maximize profit wherever the Product is sold.  
Globalization can make it very easy to make quite a bit of money.  

...wait what does "reduce the labor cost" mean?

## Part 1: The East

So, Wal-Mart has every day low prices, and very low prices at that.  
They claim that buying and selling at volume is the reason.  
But... the only way they can sell things at volume is to have them made at volume.  
This raises a question, how DOES Wal-Mart keep up such a high production rate?  
Part of it is payment, since the less you pay, the more you can hire.  
[At Wal-Mart-Approved factories in China:][01] (01)

"All five factories fail to provide workers with legally mandated minimum wage.  
In general workers earn only between 600 and 800 Yuan per month,  
despite excessive overtime work throughout the entire month."

For context, 600 to 800 Yuan is 88 to 117 US Dollars.  
That's between 3 and 6 dollars... per DAY!  
This allows the savings to be passed on to us!  
As for the wellbeing of those workers?  
Well... safety measures tend to make the "buildings and machines" part of Capital more expensive to run.  
In an Indian factory in which wal-mart products were produced,  
[over eleven-hundred people died when the building caught fire and collapsed.][02] (02)  
[Wal-Mart's response wasn't confidence-building to say the least.][03] (03)  

"Wal-Mart Stores said it won’t accept an agreement 'at this time' to improve fire and building safety  
in Bangladesh that is supported by labor monitoring groups and was signed by several retailers.  
Instead, in the wake of the deadly Rana Plaza building collapse,  
the world’s largest retailer announced that it would undertake public safety inspections  
at all of its suppliers' authorized factories in Bangladesh."

So, instead of signing on to a safety improvement agreement,  
they would conduct their own inspections and post the results.  
Labor groups in India have stated that these inspections are inadequate to ensure worker safety.  

Wal-Mart said it expects the costs of  
“appropriate remediation and ongoing safety investments to be appropriately reflected in its costs of goods purchased.”  

Ah, so if they are made to pay their workers fairly and keep their workers safe, things will cost more.  

"Kevin Gardner, a company spokesman, declined to comment on how the costs  
of increased monitoring would affect prices paid by consumers."

Since Kevin declined to comment, I will fill in the details for ya:  

Wal-Mart is using sweat shops.  
and work safety measures make sweat shops...  
not work in the brutally efficient manner by which they must operate to be profitable.  
If you don't give your workers any protections or even enough money for rent,  
you're going to have a lot of homeless and/or dead workers.  
If you need a model, take Apple Computers' primary manufacturer, Foxconn for example.  
Foxconn GIVES its workers a place to live, and has, in the past decade,  
taken measures to reduce the number of deaths in their manufacturing complexes by...  
[installing... suicide nets?][04] (04) wait WHAT!?  

"In 2010, Longhua assembly-line workers began killing themselves.  
Worker after worker threw themselves off the towering dorm buildings,  
sometimes in broad daylight, in tragic displays of desperation –  
and in protest at the work conditions inside.  
There were 18 reported suicide attempts that year alone and 14 confirmed deaths.  
Twenty more workers were talked down by Foxconn officials."

To quote a boy named Xu who used to work there:  

“'It wouldn’t be Foxconn without people dying, Every year people kill themselves.   
They take it as a normal thing.  
It’s not a good place for human beings'"

Article Continues:

"The corporate response spurred further unease: Foxconn CEO, Terry Gou,  
had large nets installed outside many of the buildings to catch falling bodies.  
The company hired counselors and workers were made to sign pledges  
stating they would not attempt to kill themselves."

That's... Not a solution.

"Suicide notes and survivors told of immense stress,  
long workdays and harsh managers who were prone to humiliate workers for mistakes,  
of unfair fines and unkept promises of benefits."

The problem is high work pressure, inadequate pay, and public ridicule for falling behind ridiculous standards.  
So why do they stay in the job? Why do they even TAKE the job!?  
According to this article:

"Most knew of the reports of poor conditions before joining,  
but they either needed the work or it didn’t bother them.  
Almost everywhere, people said the workforce was young and turnover was high.  
'Most employees last only a year' was a common refrain."

That kinda rings a bell, don't it?  
We've all heard "that's just a job for highschoolers, not a career,  
so of course turnover happens! Besides, you couldn't make a living doing that anyway."  
Usually, it's talking about working in fast food or chain retail, but the act of working is the commonality.  
They SHOULD be able to make a living doing whatever "that" is, at least enough to live under a roof...  
"Ah, but Bayonet," you retort, "you said they provided residency for workers!"  
Good catch, person I made up, why did I say that?  

"Xu and his friend were both walk-on recruits, though not necessarily willing ones.  
'They call Foxconn a fox trap,' he says. 'Because it tricks a lot of people.'  
He says Foxconn promised them free housing but then forced them to pay  
exorbitantly high bills for electricity and water.  
The current dorms sleep eight to a room and he says they used to be 12 to a room.  
But Foxconn would shirk social insurance and be late or fail to pay bonuses.  
And many workers sign contracts that subtract a hefty penalty from their pay  
if they quit before a three-month introductory period.  
"'They call Foxxcon a fox trap,' continues Xu, 'because it tricks a lot of people'"

I wouldn't really call that "provided for" so much as "swindled" or "trapped."

## Part 2: The West

This same globalized economy, being global, is in the western world as well.  
[Let's look at Amazon, owned by the richest man on earth, for an example.][05] (05)

Amazon regularly hires people with 0 guaranteed hours,  
meaning their only option is to take any hours they're given.  

"One former agency manager also alleges that Amazon tried to avoid paying out hundreds of pounds  
in accrued holiday pay to agency staff by instructing agency representatives  
not to inform employees that it was owed to them."

So if you do end up getting holiday hours, they might not even pay you extra unless you specifically ask.

"The employer allegedly issued penalty points to workers –  
for talking to colleagues, taking sick leave, or even spending too long in the bathroom – on a  
'three strikes and you’re out' basis."

If you're sick, you get penalized.  
If you have to pee, you get penalized.  
If you talk to a coworker, you get penalized.  
if you've done all 3, you are fired.

Amazon made these workers take long hours with minimal breaks,  
an example of which being a 10 hour shift with a 30 minute lunch break,  
20 minutes of which was just going through the checkpoint, and walking to and from the canteen.  
These working conditions roughly mirror those in Foxconn, but these are the "low skill" employees,  
[what about the employees with college degrees?][06] (06)

Amazon's corporate offices extend into an employee's home life,  
invading time someone might wish to use sleeping or being with their family.  
Emails that come in at midnight are followed with text messages soon afterwards  
wondering why the email wasn't answered.
Amazon boasts that its standards are "unreasonably high."  
And I have to agree with them.  
It's unreasonable to ask someone to take their job home with them,  
especially if it doesn't count for hours on the job.
That's not something to boast, that's shameful.  
And shame is what is used against people who don't fit the mold,  
public ridicule for having a different idea.  
These exploitations of our laws are pretty ridiculous.

## Part 2.1: GOD BLESS AMERICA

[Speaking of exploiting the law][07] (07)

Amazon "takes advantage of" (read: exploits) a "private partnership" deal  
in which each package sent through USPS by Amazon is sent free,  
which is allegedly giving $1.46 in value per package to Amazon from our tax dollars.  
That may not sound like a lot, you probably have a buck fifty in your house or maybe on your person,  
but given that they shipped 5 billion packages in 2017 (and 57% of amazon's market is in the US)  
That would make 4.3 billion on mail alone  
The current United States budget only allocates 23.8 billion for unemployment and labor for the entire country.  
That means we are giving equivalent to one fifth of the total unemployment budget directly to Amazon.  
Side note, this article complaining about the partnership between Amazon and the USPS  
asks congress to enforce the "Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act" to stop the  
"cost saving measure" that is the result of this partnership and uhhh...

"[Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act][08] (08)
Section 1004  
Subsection 2  
Expresses the sense of Congress that the Postal Service should implement commercial best practices  
in Postal Service purchasing policies to achieve greater efficiency and cost savings  
by taking full advantage of private-sector partnerships, as recommended in July 2003  
by the President's Commission on the United States Postal Service."

I will have to assume that isn't the part you were talking about,  
but that is the law here in the United States. Loopholes and all.  
Speaking of which, let's go back to Walmart, we only really talked about what they're doing overseas.  
They're using this global strategy here inside the United States, too.  
[Remember, they aren't an American company, they're very much a Global Corporation.][09] (09)

"Walmart's low-wage workers cost U.S. taxpayers an estimated $6.2 billion in public assistance  
including food stamps, Medicaid and subsidized housing, according to a report  
published to coincide with Tax Day, April 15.
'Walmart told analysts last year that the company  
has captured 18 percent of the SNAP market,' it reads.  
'Using that figure, we estimate that the company accounted for $13.5 billion  
out of $76 billion in food stamp sales in 2013.'"

Wal-Mart pays its workers so little that they have to use welfare programs just to survive,  
and frequently it's the only job around that has any openings within normal traveling distance.  
If we look at SNAP, we will see the biggest abuse of our laws for gain.  
SNAP, or "Food Stamps" as it's colloquially known, is being given to employees who aren't being paid enough  
by Wal-Mart, who then go to the only place nearby that takes SNAP... Wal-Mart.  
They're extracting value from both sides of this equation and leaving us with the bill  
instead of using their huge amounts of money to just pay people what they deserve.  
This brings me to my point.

## Part 3: The Problem  

Why exactly do prices need to be so low that people in other countries can barely get by?  
We aren't paid enough for our work to buy things otherwise.  
We're supposed to be the richest nation on earth, and ALL these companies make obscene amounts of money,  
so why aren't they paying anyone what they're owed?  
Quite simply, given the relatively inelastic cost of raw materials,  
cost-cutting means wage-cutting, and we will TALK about wages.  
Ownership isn't Capital or a Product, it's a passive action.  
Passive actions aren't Labor.  
Therefore, Ownership is not Labor.  
So, if it isn't a CONTRIBUTOR to a Product's value...  
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
Makes one wonder, doesn't it?  
This, as I've demonstrated, is a world-wide problem.  
It's not just 3rd world countries being dominated by this abuse,  
it's here in the 1st world, and it's barely even hiding in plain sight anymore.  
The best solution to this is us, the people who work, taking control  
of business decisions in a very significant way.  
Whether that be organizing to collectively bargain for our own pay and working conditions,  
or to own the business as a worker's collective and make all decisions democratically.  
This cannot be fixed from the top down, and assuming otherwise is dooming ourselves to poverty  
for the comfort of not having to think about it.
