# Ahoy hoy! **Welcome to the New South!**

I'm Luna, but you can call me the ***People's Bayonet!***

# Who are you?
I am ~~an actress, writer, electronic engineer, musician, graphic designer, visual artist, dishwasher, radio enthusiast, teacher, web developer, disabled mess~~ a **worker**.

Am I qualified for any of those things? That all depends on what you mean by qualified.

I grew up with a hard working mother and a hard working father, so I come from a long line of people who never stopped working, and I intend to carry on that legacy as I don't intend to stop working, so I will continue to do so until my heart gives out.

As for education? Well, just because we work hard doesn't mean we have money for trade school or college. I rest my qualifications on having put in the work.

# Why is this all text?
Good question! I decided to do everything in my power to make this website as easy to view as possible for everybody within and without this great land. A lot of hard working Americans don't have high speed Internet access, and many people outside the US may barely have Internet access at all.

As such, all of my videos are free to download, available in multiple resolutions, and reproduced in whole in text as transcripts and as subtitles on audio.
