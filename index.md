## Who are you?
I am ~~an actress, writer, electronic engineer, musician, graphic designer, visual artist, dishwasher, radio enthusiast, teacher, web developer, disabled mess~~ a **worker**.

Am I qualified for any of those things? That all depends on what you mean by qualified. I grew up with a hard working mother and a hard working father, so I come from a long line of people who never stopped working. I intend to carry on that legacy as I don't intend to stop working, so I will continue to do so until my heart gives out. As for education? Well, just because we work hard doesn't mean we have money for trade school or college. I rest my qualifications on having put in the work.

## Who funds you?  
You do! Or, people like you do at least. I provide this for free supported in part by [my Patreon supporters](https://patreon.com/peoplesbayonet) If you can give, I appreciate the help in spreading the message, and I'll forever be in the people's debt.  

## Why is this all text?
Good question! I decided to do everything in my power to make this website as easy to view as possible for everybody within and without this great land. A lot of hard working Americans don't have high speed Internet access, and many people outside the US may barely have Internet access at all. As such, all of my videos are free to download, available in multiple resolutions, and reproduced in whole in text as transcripts and as subtitles on audio.

## A few things before we get started:  
-I am hard of hearing.  
-I ALSO hate the sound of my voice!  
-I will be swearing as little as possible so people can share these videos,  
-but I will not be censoring anything.  
-There are currently no political parties that share my values and ideas,  
-and there have been exactly 0 presidents I have liked in my lifetime,  
-including the ones I can't remember,  
-so don't act surprised when I attack a party or president.  
-it's gonna happen a lot, as I will be talking about the power dynamics I personally believe to be at the core of most problems here in America  
-If you are being rude and unconstructive, I will delete your comment. Nobody Needs That.  

Alright. That's about it!
