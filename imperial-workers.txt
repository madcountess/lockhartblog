workers in imperial core states are not only ALSO being oppressed by imperial nations, but also oppressed doubly as they are subject to the imperialists within their own owning class. So long as the dictatorship of the owning class persists, none are free from imperialism

it may no longer be the case that monopolists rule the roost, but private mergers are happening in ways that approximate monopoly with the blessing of the state.

We are subject to foreign capital because these ersatz-monopolies are frequently multinational corporations.

Ask anybody "where do profits go?" and there's a good chance they'll respond somthin to the effect of "the cayman islands" but what is in the cayman islands? international banks that profit from multi-industry corporate combines in countries across the globe!

we hear investor as "millionaire" but real investors sink billions of dollars into controlling more than they own, and hiding their income from taxation as "Capital Gains."

investors can be in the meetings where the money is made, but you must invest more than a worker can make.

the petit bourgeois and labor aristocracy in the US may be able to invest enough to get real returns on investment, but the rest of us are left to either play the stock market or the crypto market, and there's little solace in either. The concentration of capital is staggering.

in american capitalism, multinational corporations serve the same purpose as the syndicates of old, and the corporations themselves own the means and control the production, but politically, the banks have a huge amount of control.

big corporations hide their profits off-shore, thus becoming multinational, and these international banks profit greatly from the profit accelerator model of growth (that is, the model of growth in which expansion is put above rational / stable profit)
