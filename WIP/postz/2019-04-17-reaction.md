**`Ah yes, we do like getting reactions out of each-other don't we, fellow humans.`**  
Sorry, I know this is going to sound really unnatural to talk about,  
so do try to bear with me here.  
For the purposes of this video, to React means to Respond with action, rather than with thought  
Patronizing, I'm sure. But what is the purpose of reaction? What role does it play in our day-to-day lives?

##	Brands

When we react, we are not using our calm brains to make rational decisions,  
we're using our panicked brains to make irrational decisions.  
You want the price?

\*Popcorn ad*  
"call now!"

ACT!

\*Sticky Buddy ad*  
"Order right now and you can double the value!"

NOW!
You want the extra?

\*OxyClean ad*  
"butcha gotta call now!"

BUY!

\*ShamWow ad*  
"if you call now, in the next 20 minutes 'cause you know we can't do this all day"

NOW!  
For your...

\*RamenJoy ad*  
"use your seasoning packet to make an AWESOME DRESSING!"

Ramen...Packet...Awesome...Sauce... Whatever.  
You want the message?  
They're selling a fake reality to you that you are the best  
You just need that one thing to fix you...  
That's how those pyramid schemes and weird devices you are sure are  
"too obvious for anyone to fall for" make their profit.  
If you have a problem, they have a solution.

\*Various Infomercial Bad Acting*  

Out of shape?

\*Bowflex ad*  
"The power to change and reshape your ENTIRE BODY"

Tired?

\*5 Hour Energy ad*
"Hours of energy now, no 2:30 Feeling (tm) later"

Poor?

\*Grant Money Riddler ad*  
"Like being on vacation EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!  
now here's your chance to get the government to pay for it!"

Don't worry.

\*Disclosure Music Video Clip* "The spirit is alive in the buliding!"

We know the REAL problem.

"We see you sinner!"

And we just happen to sell the solution!

"You need to be saved"

DON'T DELAY!

"we're here savin' people!"

ACT NOW!

"THE FIRE STARTS TO BURN!"

||	Talk about Alex Jones' dangerous ideas, but don't use the common examples used by Some More News or Last Week Tonight



>>	Alex Jones and his lifestyle brand InfoLife have been publicly ridiculed for the poor quality of the product they sell, so what product is he -actually- selling us?



>>	Now to the core, to the purest reaction
|-	Fluoride is killing us https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS83cVE1vcY [1:30]

>>	Ah. There it is.
>>	Pure reaction itself.
>>	Old tales of the devil at the crossroads, giving blues men talent in exchange for their souls.
>>	Monsters in the closet, pushers in the streets, witches sacrificing the unborn, escaped madmen bent on murder, the spectre of CHAOS!
>>	These ideas are challenges to seek out difference and destroy it, to respond to anything outside the norm, not with thought, but with action.
**	Draw Thumb Across Throat
>>	Alex's philosophical ancestors,
>>	The Democrats,
>>	Reacted to the end of slavery by instituting Jim Crow laws
>>	They reacted to the end of the Jim Crow laws by building statues glorifying the confederacy where former slaves and their descendants would congregate or have to pass by on their way to work or at the courthouse.
>>	Do you know how they reacted to THEIR descendants getting full civil rights?
>>	They built more confederate statues and left the Democratic Party.
>>	That's not acting in a manner that implies thought was given.
>>	That's responding with action, devoid of thought.
>>	Put thought into your actions, be a collaborator rather than a reactionary.
>>	Don't be a follower, and...
>>	Don't flinch.
