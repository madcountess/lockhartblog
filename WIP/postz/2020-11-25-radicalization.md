## On Radicalization

Tell me all about yourself.  
What is your purpose?  
How does your life change from day-to-day?  
Does the darkness scare you?  
Does the darkness bring you comfort?  
Who makes you happy?  
Who makes you mad?  

What about danger draws us in?  
What drives us into the grips of our enemies when safety is within grasp?  
Why do we tire of that safety?  
How do we escape the pan? and Can we keep from falling into the fire?  
My name is Danger.  
First, middle, and last.  
Danger gives us a goal.  
Danger gives us the goal of survival.  
We are driven to danger because complacency isn't safety.  
Safety in the presence of oppressive forces isn't safety, it's complacency.  
Complacency within a market society is the comfort of the oppressor being spread to the preferred group.  
Complacency is the expectation that oppression won't fall upon your shoulders.  
We tire of complacency because that oppression falls upon the shoulders of our friends.  
Our families.  
Our species.  
Our shoulders are not without weight, and we will either support the oppressors, or we can support the oppressed.  
That realization is tiring.  
Knowing how hard the work is can drive us to complacency.  
We can only escape the pan by oppressing each-other and ourselves...  
Or we can escape into the fire.  
Even though we currently live in isolation.  
Even though we may have no power alone.  
We have power together, and the oppressor cannot oppress forever,  
because the power minority outstrips the power majority in population 10 to 1.  
We can stop them.  
If we try.  

My name is Danger.  
First, middle and last.  
Tell me about you.  
Tell me your name.  
Do you have draw to a flame?  
Do I excite you when you gaze upon my fire?  
Does the inferno in my stare cause you dread?  
Do the embers in my soul bring you to my hearth?  
Does my heat drive you away?  
Know yourself.  
Know the threat.  
Know that my tongue is sharper than a knife.  
Know me.  
My name is Danger.  
First, Middle, and Last.  
You must risk burning  
To escape your past.
