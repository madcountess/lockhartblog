# Mission Statement for a New South

### We Are The **Workers**

A New South will rise from the ashes of the old to throw out the parasites, to dump the bosses off our backs, to unite against yesterday's oppressors for a brighter South tomorrow!  
We southerners ain't stupid, we know what's happening, we know the people in charge don't give a single damn about us!  
We know they think we're idiots for "MaKiNg BaD dEcIsIoNs" like we got a choice.  
We know they think we're disposable because we're "idiots."  
We know they treat us like chattel because we're "disposable."  
We are not CHATTEL!  
We are not DISPOSABLE!  
We are not IDIOTS!  
We are WORKERS and we **DO NOT COMPROMISE WITH THE TERRORISTIC THREATS OF BOSSES!**  
We are ***WORKERS*** and we have MADE the decision to organize and fight!  
What do we have in common with the greedy parasite?  
Do they work?  
No.  
Do they get paid more than the people who do?  
Yes.  
In our hands is placed a power greater than their hoarded gold!  
WE have the power!  
*WE* should own the business!  
**WE** will not surrender!  
***WE CAN BRING FORTH A NEW SOUTH, TO RISE FROM THE ASHES OF THE OLD!***  
We... are workers.  
And the union makes us strong.
